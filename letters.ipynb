I missed you the first few days, and it was strange for me not to find you when I came home in the afternoon. We spent some pleasant days together, and actually did go for some walks and see a thing or two whenever we had the chance. Your loving Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b1 V/19The Hague, 13 December 1872. My dear Theo, I don’t doubt that it will give you pleasure, it’s such a fine firm. It will be a big change for you. I hope so much to see you before you leave, we’ll have a lot to talk about. I believe that Brussels is a very pleasant city, though it will seem strange at first. At all events, write to me soon. And now adieu, these are only a few words written in haste, but I just had to tell you how very glad I was. I wish you well, and believe me ever, Your loving brother Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b2 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘den Haag 13 December 1872The Hague, January 1873 My dear Theo, I heard from home that you arrived safe and sound in Brussels, and that your first impression was good. How pleasant those days at Christmas were, I think of them so often; they’ll also long be remembered by you, as they were also your last days at home. You must write to me in particular about what kind of paintings you see and what you find beautiful. I’m really very happy that you’re also part of this firm. It’s such a fine firm, the longer one is part of it the more enthusiastic one becomes. The beginning is perhaps more difficult than in other jobs, but keep your chin up and you’ll get along. Adieu Your loving brother Vincent. You know that my address is Lange Beestenmarkt 32 or Maison Goupil & Cie, Plaats. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b3 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘Den Haag Januari 1873’. The date is based on the fact that Theo has already been in Brussels for some time and Vincent has meanwhile had a busy start to the new year. From a letter written by Mrs van Gogh it emerges that Theo wrote to Vincent on 22 January at the latest: ‘just imagine, on Monday and Tuesday morning we received good letters from all three absentees ... [Vincent] will surely be glad that you wrote to him and could also tell him the good news’ (FR b2595, 23 January 1873, to Theo). Evidently Vincent had not yet received this letteThe Hague, 28 Jan. 1873 My dear Theo, It’s good that you answered me so quickly. I’m glad that things are to your liking and that you’ve been lucky with your boarding-house. Be of good heart if things sometimes get difficult, everything will come right later on, and no one can do what he really wants in the beginning.

How is business with you? It must be busy, as it is here. You probably know your way around by now.  I’m very curious about the English painters, we see so little of them, because almost everything stays in England. Your loving brother Vincent I just received your letter, for which I thank you. I’m very pleased with the portrait, it turned out well. If I hear anything more about my trip to Helvoirt I’ll write to you immediately. It would be nice if we could arrive on the same day. Adieu. Theo, I must again recommend that you start smoking a pipe. It does you a lot of good when you’re out of spirits, as I quite often am nowadays.

It’s so refreshing when I receive a letter. Vincent Slowly the toll of the angelus-bell resounded o’er the fields, As they blissfully bathed in the gold of the evening sun. O solemn, moving moment! When every mother in the village suddenly Stops the whirring of the wheel to bless herself with the sign of the cross; While in the field the farmer reins in his steaming horses, And, behind the plough, bares his head to murmur an Ave. O solemn, moving moment! When the bell that proclaims far and wide The end of the day’s work makes those powerful, dripping heads Bow down for Him who causes the sweat in the furrow to thrive. For the artist, too, on the slope of yon shady hill, Absorbed in his painting from the earliest morning, The angelus now gave the sign to retreat. Slowly he wiped His brush and palette, which he stowed with his canvas in the valise, Folded his camp-stool and dreamily descended the path That leads, gently winding, through the flowery dale to the village. Yet how oft, before reaching the foot of the hill, did he Stand admiringly still, to imprint on his mind once again The refreshing scene down below, unfolding before his eyes. Just before him lay the village, with a hill to north and to south, Between whose crests the sun, inflamed and sinking in the west, Let flow the whole wealth of its colours and up-conjured glory. The bell, in the grey tower entwined with black-green ivy, Was now silent. Hanging motionless on high were the brown Sails of the windmill; the leaves stood still and above the huts Blue clouds of peat-smoke ascended so straight from the chimneys That they, too, seemed to hang motionless in the shimmering air. ’Twas as though this village, this field, those hills, as though everything, Before wrapping itself in a cloak of evening dew to sleep Beneath the sun’s parting kiss, silently and gratefully Recalled once more the peace and plenty it had again savoured.  Soon, though, this silence was gently disturbed by the sweet sounds Of the evening. In the distance, from a hollow in the hill echoed Lingeringly the sound of the cow-horn, calling the cattle. And at this sign from their herdsman there soon appeared in the furrowed Sandy mountain road the whole of a colourful herd of cows. Cracking and smacking, the lad’s lash drove them forward, While they, as if by turns, their necks outstretched, with friendly lowing Greeted from afar the cow-shed where the milkmaid Waited for them each evening to ease their taut udders. Thus on the paths running out from the village like spokes From an axle, there slowly came movement and life. Here, ’twas a farmer, dragging homeward a harrow or plough There, a blushing lass, on her head a lock of sweet clover Laced with daisies and poppies, called from afar to the others, Kindly and gaily at once, her clear-toned ‘good evening’. Further... But on the same track where the painter’s path Led, he suddenly heard peals of joyous laughter. Rocking from side to side, a wagon, nearly toppling Under its load of fresh-harvested buckwheat, came rumbling closer, Both horse and burden adorned with fluttering ribbons and greenery. Children, all with wreaths of flowers on their little flaxen heads, Were seated on top, happily waving branches of alder, Or scattering flowers and leaves, which rained down on all sides, While round the wagon a troop of country lads and lasses Skipped and sang enough to startle the whole drowsy plain. Quietly smiling, the Painter, from behind the thicket, Watched as the revellers slowly wound their way down the rutted road. ‘Aye’, he thus mumbled, ‘Aye, the Lord must think it A happy sound, the jubilance with which these hearts So simply pour forth their thanks as they gather the last Fruits, which He yearly lets grow fully ripe from their toil. Yea, for the purest prayer of simplicity and innocence is joy!’ And thus contemplating the calm, deep delight upon which the soul Feasts in the fields; or with his artist’s mind reconstructing In silent rapture the glorious scene of a moment ago, He found he had sauntered, unnoticing, into the village. Already the purple and yellow had faded to grey in the west, And in the east there had risen close by the little church the full Copper-coloured disc of the moon, in mist enshrouded, When he entered The Swan, the inn where he boarded.

Things are going all right for me here, I have a nice home, and even though the firm isn’t as exciting as the Hague branch, it’s perhaps good that I’m here, and later on especially, when the trade in paintings becomes a little more important, I’ll possibly be of use. And then, I can’t tell you how interesting it is to see London and the trade and the way of life here, which are so very different from ours.

See Breton 1875, pp. 75-7[Letterhead: Goupil Paris] Paris, 13 Dec. 1875 My dear Theo, I’m longing for Christmas and to see you, old boy, but now we’ll be there soon enough. I’ll probably be leaving here Thursday week, in the evening. Do everything you can to get as long a holiday as possible. I sincerely wish you the best and, again, a speedy recovery. Ever Your loving brother. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b62 V/19[Letterhead: Goupil Paris] My dear Theo, I haven’t written to you since we saw each other; in the meantime something has happened that didn’t come as a total surprise to me. And now, old boy, so far I’m really rather in the dark about what I should do, but we must try and keep hope and courage alive. Do write again soon, and believe me ever, Your loving brother Vincent.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b63 V/1962 Vincent returned to Paris on Monday, 3 January, and the next day Mr van Gogh wrote to Theo: ‘But how happy and grateful we are that you take pleasure in your work. If only V. had that too! His outlook on life does tend to be a bit too morbid. He left yesterday morning at half past eight, and thought it better not to decide straightaway about changing jobs. He has promised, however, to keep a close eye on what awaits him there, and to try and act wisely. We hope for the best, but are not without worry. There is a lot of eccentricity in him, but much good as well. We keep our sights fixed on God. He can put worries and troubles to shame’ (FR b2225, 4 January 1876). Later in the letter Mrs van Gogh takes the pen: after first expressing her disappointment, she writes: ‘what a disappointment for you too, dear Theo, we can understand you commiserate with us, we see no light, but know that the good Lord has so often given it, when things were very bleak. We will hope for it; Uncle Cor, to whom Vincent also wrote, sent us a very sympathetic answer, but could offer no help either, certainly not in his firm’ (FR b2227). The close of the letter seems to indicate that Uncle Cor had said he had no place for Vincent in his own art dealership in Amsterdam. Four days later it became apparent that Vincent had had another talk with Boussod, about which Mr van Gogh wrote: ‘I had advised him to speak to Mr Boussod, and he did so, and was not received unfavourably ... There is certainly a lot of good in him. If only he could acquire a bit more tact to make an agreeable impression’ (FR b2228). Vincent had not intended to resign, as emerges from a remark made by Mr van Gogh on 3 January 1876 in a letter to Theo: ‘he means to stay there, but will decide later what seems best’ (FR b2224). His dismissal was not rescinded, howeve[Letterhead: Goupil Paris] Paris, January 1876 My dear Theo, In the first crate going to The Hague you’ll find various packages; be so good as to take care of them.

My dear Theo, I arrived here safe and sound yesterday afternoon at 1 o’clock, and one of my first impressions was that the window of the not-very-large school looks out over the sea. It’s a boarding school and there are 24 boys between the ages of 10 and 14. There’s another assistant teacher, 17 years old. The houses on the sea-front are mostly built of yellow brick in the style of those in Nassaulaan in The Hague (but taller), and have gardens full of cedars and other dark evergreen shrubs. There’s a harbour full of all kinds of ships, closed in by stone jetties running into the sea on which one can walk. And further out one sees the sea in its natural state, and that’s beautiful. Yesterday everything was grey. I’m shortly going to unpack my trunks which have just been brought, and hang up some prints in my room. (The assistant teacher, 4 boys and I sleep in another house close by.) Your most loving brother Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b74 V/19Ramsgate, 21 April 1876 My dear Theo, We go to the beach often; this morning I helped the boys build a sand-castle like those we made in the garden at Zundert. When I was in Rotterdam and saw that I’d have to wait there a long time, I very nearly came to The Hague, even went to the station. And yet I didn’t do it, I hope that later I’ll be able to see everyone and everything there again with a calmer eye. I shake your hand in thought, and ever Your loving brother Vincent Do write soon. A young lady, a clergyman’s daughter, having worked in England for some time, is looking for a situation as lady’s companion or nurse to a sickly lady. Tell no one that you’re placing the advertisement. You can see from the letter that she’d prefer you didn’t.

The ground we walked on was completely covered with large grey stones, chalk and shells. To the right the sea, as calm as a pond, reflecting the delicate grey sky where the sun was setting. It was ebb tide and the water was very low. Have a pleasant day today, and give my regards to everyone who asks after me, and believe me Your loving brother Vincent. I wish you well today, old boy, and begin a happy and blessed year. These are important years for us both, years on which much already depends. May everything turn out well.

And now you ask what I have to teach the boys; chiefly French, fundamentals, one boy has started to learn German, and also a variety of things like sums, hearing them their lessons, giving dictations &c. For the time being, then, giving the lessons isn’t so difficult, but it’ll be more difficult to make the boys learn them. And now today is your birthday, I shake your hand in thought, and once again I sincerely wish you blessings and all the best.

The sea was yellowish, especially close to the beach; a streak of light on the horizon and, above this, tremendously huge dark grey clouds from which one saw the rain coming down in slanting streaks. The wind blew the dust from the small white path on the rocks into the sea and tossed the blossoming hawthorn bushes and wallflowers that grow on the rocks. Another extraordinary place is the room with the rotten floor where there are 6 basins at which they wash themselves, with only a feeble light falling onto the washstand through a window with broken panes. It’s quite a melancholy sight, to be sure. How I’d like to spend or to have spent a winter with them, to know what it’s like.

The word of the Lord came unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying, Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. He so went and did according unto the word of the Lord: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said unto him, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! So they went down to Beth-el. And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. And Elijah said unto him, Elisha! tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! So they came to Jericho. And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so. And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.

It was a delight to take a long walk again, very little walking is done here at school. When I think of my life of struggle in Paris last year and now here, where sometimes I can’t leave the house for a whole day, or at least no further than the garden, then I sometimes think, when will I return to that world? If I do return to it, though, it will probably be some other kind of work than I did last year. But I think that I prefer doing biblical history with the boys to walking; one feels more or less safe doing the former.

And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not Charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

The first is the story of a horror-stricken mother who sets out in search of her daughter, who has been claimed by Death.

When her shoes are put under a spell and cannot stop dancing, she has her feet chopped off. She goes to work for a preacher, whom she helps ‘diligently and thoughtfully’, finally realizing that it is not splendour and finery that is important, but the attainment of God’s grace. ‘The little matchseller’ is the tale of a little girl who is sent out on a cold New Year’s Eve to sell matches.

I am grieved, but it’s a godly sadness A night-cloud – tinged all round with dawn’s bright crimson I weep, Lord, though my heart is full of gladness I bow my head – but, Father, in thy bosom. Father in my great affliction, Father, who punishes and saves, Father, e’en in death’s own kingdom, Father, too, in the silent grave. Where’er I see inconstancy, God, Thou takest a firm stand. My dust, too, rests in Thy loyalty And slumbers in Thy fatherly hand. Years, go quickly, fly by swiftly With your gladness and travail Whatever evil I bewail Though we sit in mournful darkness That eternal light will blaze All its glory and resplendence I know in Whom my faith is founded, Though day and night change constantly, I know the rock on which I’m grounded, My Saviour waits, unfailingly.

Sometimes hearts that are drooping Grow full to the o’erflowing And they that behold it Do wonder and know not That God at their fountains Dear Theo, How I’d like to be with you, though, oh why are we all so far apart? But what shall we do about it? Herewith I’m copying out a few psalms, you might like to read them at this time. Write a few words soon if you can. A week ago on Saturday I made a long journey to London, and there I heard about a situation that might be of future interest. The clergymen in such seaside places as Liverpool and Hull, for example, often have need of assistants who speak various languages to work among the seamen and foreigners, and also to visit the sick. In addition, such a situation would be salaried. I see the lights of the village Gleam through the rain and the mist And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me That my soul cannot resist A feeling of sadness and longing That is not akin to pain And resembles sorrow only As the mist resembles the rain Come read to me some poem Some simple and heartfelt lay That shall soothe this restless feeling And banish the thoughts of day. Not from the grand old masters Not from the bards sublime Whose distant footsteps echo Through the corridors of time Read from some humbler poet, Whose songs gushed from his heart As showers from the clouds of summer Or tears from the eyelids start. Who through long days of labour And nights devoid of ease, Still heard in his soul the music Of wonderful melodies Such songs have power to quiet The restless pulse of care And come like the benediction Why art thou cast down, my soul, Disquieted in me, oh why? Foster again the faith of old, Rejoice in praising Him most high. Oft hath he taken your distress And turned it into happiness. Hope in Him, eyes heavenward raised, Your most loving brother, Vincent. Psalm 23 The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: And I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. Psalm 91 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His wings, and under His wings shalt thou trust: His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because Thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, Thy habitation; There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For He shall give his angels charge to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known My name. He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. Psalm 121 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made Heaven and earth. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. I know in Whom my faith is founded, Though day and night change constantly, I know the rock on which I’m grounded, My Saviour waits, unfailingly. When once life’s evening overcomes me, Worn down by ills and strife always, For every day Thou hast allowed me, Father in my great affliction, Father, who punishes and saves, Father, e’en in death’s own kingdom, Father, too, in the silent grave. Where’er I see inconstancy, God, Thou takest a firm stand. My dust, too, rests in Thy loyalty Though catastrophes come hither, Refuge I shall find in thee. Thou art in Thy Son my Father, The night is come but not too soon; And sinking silently, All silently the little moon Drops down beneath the sky. There is no light in heaven and earth But the cold light of stars; And the first watch of night is given To the red planet Mars. Is it the tender star of love? The star of love and dreams? Oh no, from that blue tent above, A hero’s armour gleams And earnest thoughts within me rise, When I behold afar, Suspended in the evening skies, The shield of that red star O star of strength, I see thee stand And smile upon my pain Thou beckonest with thy mailed hand And I am strong again Within my breast there is no light, But the cold light of stars; I give the first watch of the night To the red planet Mars. The star of the unconquered will, He rises in my breast Serene and resolute and still, And calm and selfpossessed. And thou, too, whosoe’er thou art That readest this brief psalm As one by one thy hopes depart Be resolute and calm. O fear not in a world like this And thou shalt know ’ere long Know how sublime a thing it is To suffer and be strong.

Dear Theo, It’s Saturday again, and I’m writing a few words once more. I’m longing so much to see you again, oh, I can long for it so much sometimes. Do write soon and tell me how you are. The clouds kept their red glow long after the sun had set and the twilight was gathering over the fields, and in the distance we saw the street-lamps being lit in the village. This morning there was also a beautiful sunrise. I see it every morning when I wake the boys up. It is the hour when Paris shows herself in all her beauty. During the day, the plaster of the facades fatigues the eye with its monotonous whiteness, the heavily laden carts make the cobblestones shudder under their huge wheels, the hurrying crowds cross and collide, intent on not missing a moment of business; there is something harsh, anxious, breathless about the city. But everything changes the moment the stars come out; the white houses fade into misty shadow; nothing is to be heard but the wheels of carriages as they bowl along on their way to some party or other; nothing is to be seen but people strolling idly or gaily by; work gives way to leisure. Now everyone draws breath from that fierce race through the day’s activities; what strength remains is given over to pleasure! See the dance-halls lighting up their colonnades, the theatres opening, the tit-bit stalls lining the avenues, the newsvendors making their lanterns shine. Paris has clearly put aside the pen, the ruler and the apron; after the day dedicated to work it wants to keep the evening for enjoyment; like the masters of Thebes it has put off serious business till the morrow. I love to share this festive time — not to take part in the general gaiety but to observe it. The joy of others may embitter jealous hearts, but it fortifies submissive hearts; it is the ray of sunshine that opens up those two lovely flowers called ‘confidence’ and ‘hope’. In sorrow did I bow my head There is no peace on earth I said The world is strong And mocks the song Of ‘peace on earth, Goodwill to men’! Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: ‘God is not dead! nor doth He sleep! What’s wrong shall fail What’s right prevail Your most loving brother, Vincent Psalm 107 O Give thanks unto the Lord, for His mercy endureth forever. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He hath redeemed. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses. And He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. He brought them out of darkness, and brake their bands in sunder. For He hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. He sent His word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. They that go down to the sea in ships, these see the great works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep. For He commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the Heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and He bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so He bringeth them unto their desired haven.

Only those who brave its dangers Comprehend its mystery!”’ See Longfellow 1886-1891, vol. 1, pp. 260-26My dear Theo, ‘This shall be the covenant that I will make with them; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be My people.  Just get well soon, old chap, oh, how I long for Christmas. The acacias in the playground have already lost many of their leaves, one sees them through the window in front of my reading-desk, sometimes they stand out dark against the sky, sometimes one sees the sun behind them, rising up red in the mist. It will surely be winter soon, how fortunate that Christmas is in the winter, that’s why I like winter better than any other season, Christmas and New Year’s Eve are even better than the autumn. Many battles must be fought Much of life with suffering fraught Many prayers must needs be said Your most loving brother Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b93 V/1962 ‘Daer moet veel strijdts gestreden sijn: Daer moet veel leets geleden sijn: En veel gebedts gebeden sijn: En Christelijcke zeden sijn: Een nauwen wech betreden sijn; Soo lang wij hier beneden sijn: Soo sal ’t hier nae in vreden sijn.’ (Many battles must be fought Much of life with suffering fraught  Many prayers one must needs pray And Christian morals should hold sway A straight and narrow way be tread As long as life on earth is led Hereafter peace doth lie ahead.Isleworth My dear Theo, It’s again high time that you heard something from me. Thank God you’re recovering, I long so much for Christmas – perhaps that time will come before we know it, even though it seems a long way off. I know in Whom my faith is founded, Though day and night change constantly, I know the rock on which I’m grounded, My Saviour waits, unfailingly. When once life’s evening overcomes me, Worn down by ills and strife always, For every day Thou hast allowed me, Praise, Christian, there on your left hand, And on your right, is God – When I have no more strength to stand, When anguished, there is God – When loving hand of faithful friend Helps not, there is God – In death and agony at life’s end, How I long for Christmas and to see all of you, old boy, it seems to me that I’ve grown years older in these few months. The panting hart, the hunt escapèd, Cries no harder for the pleasure Of fresh flowing streams of water Than my soul doth long for God. Yea, my soul thirsts for the Lord, God of life, oh when shall I Approach Thy sight, and drawing nigh, Why art thou cast down, my soul, Disquieted in me, oh why? Foster again the faith of old, Rejoice in praising Him most high. Oft hath he taken your distress And turned it into happiness. Hope in Him, eyes heavenward raised, Your most loving brother, Vincent Your brother was indeed moved when he stood at the foot of the pulpit and bowed his head and prayed ‘Abba, Father, let Thy name be our beginning’. On the road from earth to Heaven We are weak but Thou art mighty Do we not feel this sometimes on the sea of our lives. Does not everyone of you feel with me the storms of life or their forebodings or their recollections? We have spoken of the storms on the journey of life, but now let us speak of the calms and joys of Christian life. And yet, my dear friends, let us rather cling to the seasons of difficulty and work and sorrow, even for the calms are treacherous often. The heart that is fainting May grow full to o’erflowing And they that behold it Shall wonder and know not That God at its fountains ‘There must much strife be striven There must much suffering be suffered There must much prayer be prayed and the other: The water comes up to the lips Amen. And now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, our Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us for evermore. (Reading Scripture Psalm XCI) Tossed with rough winds and faint with fear, Above the tempest soft and clear What still small accents greet mine ear ‘’t Is I, be not afraid.’ ’t Is I, who washed thy spirit white; ’t Is I, who gave thy blind eyes sight, ’t Is I, thy Lord, thy life, thy light, ’t Is I, be not afraid. These raging winds, this surging sea Have spent their deadly force on me They bear no breath of wrath to Thee ’t Is I, be not afraid. This bitter cup, I drank it first To thee it is no draught accurst The hand that gives it thee is pierced ‘’t Is I, be not afraid’. When on the other side thy feet, Shall rest, mid thousand welcomes sweet; One well known voice thy heart shall greet – ’t Is I, be not afraid.

My dear Theo, What lovely autumn weather we’re having. You probably see the sun rising in the morning too. Which room are you sleeping in? There’s a new assistant teacher at the school, because I’ll have to work more at Turnham Green from now on. He has never been away from home before, and won’t find it easy in the beginning. And now a handshake in thought, it’s already late and I’m rather tired. I wish you well. Do think now and then of Your most loving and affectionate brother Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b94 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘Isleworth 10 November 1876Isleworth, 25 Nov. 1876 My dear Theo, Two lovers by a mossgrown spring They leaned soft cheeks together Mingled the dark and sunny hair, And heard the wooing thrushes sing o Budding time o Loves best prime. Two wedded from the portal steps The bells made happy carolings The air was soft as fanning wings While petals on the pathway slept O pure eyed bride o tender pride. Two faces o’er a cradle bent Two hands above the head were locked These pressed each other while they rocked Those watched a life which love had sent O solemn hour o hidden power. Two parents by the evening fire The red light fell about their knees On heads that rose by slow degrees Like buds upon the lily spire O patient life O tender strife. The two still sat together there The red light shone about their knees But all the heads by slow degrees Had gone and left that lonely pair O Voyage fast O Banished past. The red light shone upon the floor And made the space between them wide They drew their chairs up side by side O, memories! O past that is! They sat alone by the bright woodfire The grey-haired dame and the aged sire Dreaming of days gone by; The tear drop fell on the wrinkled cheek They both had thoughts that they could not speak, And each heart uttered a sigh. For their sad and tearful eyes descried Three little chairs placed side by side Against the sitting room wall; Old fashioned enough as there they stood Their seats of flag, and their frames of wood, With their backs so straight and tall. Then the sire shook His silvery head, And with trembling voice he gently said, ‘Mother, those empty chairs, They bring us such sad, sad thoughts tonight, We’ll put them for ever out of sight In the small dark room upstairs’. But she answered: Father, no, not yet; For I look at them, and I forget That the children went away, The boys come back, and our Mary, too, With her apron on of checkered blue And sit here every day. Johnny still whittles a ships tall masts, And Willie his leaden bullets casts While Mary her patchwork sows; At evening time three childish prayers Go up to God from those little chairs, So softly that no one knows. Johnny comes back from the billowy deep, Willie wakes from the battle field sleep, To say good night to me: Mary’s a wife and mother no more, But a tired child whose play-time is o’er, And comes to rest on my knee. So let them stand there – though empty now, And every time when alone we bow At the Fathers throne to pray, We’ll ask to meet the children above In our Saviours home of rest and love, Where no child goeth away. Your most loving brother Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b96 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘Isleworth 25 Nov. 1876My dear Theo, And now this evening New Year’s Eve again, if only you were here. How often we’ve longed to be together, and how terrible it is to feel so far away from one another in cases of illness or anxiety, as we felt, for example, during your illness, and then the feeling that lack of money may very well stand in the way of our being together in times of need.

Rejoice on earth, praise God on high, Let thankful tears stream from your eye For Him from whom all blessings flow. This joyful day then celebrate, The greatest the world has seen to date, Still welcoming us, that blessed night, In which the stars with beauteous light And heavenly hosts with one glad voice I know in Whom my faith is founded, Though day and night change constantly, I know the rock on which I’m grounded, My Saviour waits, unfailingly.

Write soon about how you got home, and whether that walk and the journey didn’t exhaust you too much. Am longing for a letter from you, also to hear whether you’ll be going to Etten. Accept in thought a handshake, and believe me Your loving brother, Vincent The night is come, but not too soon, And sinking silently All silently the little moon Drops down beneath the sky. There is no light in earth or heaven But the cold light of stars And the first watch of night is given To the red planet Mars. Is it the tender star of love The star of love and dreams Oh no! from that blue tent above A hero’s armour gleams. And earnest thoughts within me rise When I behold afar Suspended in the evening skies The shield of that red star. O star of strength I see thee stand And smile upon my pain Thou beckonest with thy mailed hand And I am strong again. Within my breast there is no light But the red light of stars I give the first watch of the night To the red planet Mars. The star of the unconquered will He rises in my breast Serene and resolute and still And calm and selfpossessed. And thou too, whosoe’er thou art That readest this brief psalm As one by one thy hopes depart Be resolute and calm. O, fear not in a world like this And thou shalt know ere long Know, how sublime a thing it is To suffer and be strong. After years of city toil I hear the old church bells They sing a strange new song Whilst the old song in my memory dwells A strange new song, with strange new words That many sorrows bring And sorrowful I once again The child puts great faith in his Father As befits the father’s worth.

Even for me, though, the hour was nearing Of calling, of mercy, of seriousness, When in my bosom the voice I’d been hearing Enquired ‘Do you love Me?’ – my soul answered ‘Yes’. Since that hour of waking my dreams are no longer, Another now leads me, at times ’gainst my will, Teaches my hands to reach eagerly further, To follow and carry, oh, happy and still. Yet now that life’s governed by the Supreme Being Despite pain and fetters, my soul torn apart – I find what in life I’d once vainly been seeking: More rest and more peace for my uneasy heart. There is no Priest who can explain Him whom no one seeks in vain. Although into Elijah I cannot transform The Lord soared past me after the storm. Writing to you in haste between tasks, adieu, a hearty handshake in thought from Your most loving brother Vincent I know in whom my faith is founded, Though day and night change constantly, I know the rock on which I’m grounded, My Saviour waits, unfailingly. When once life’s evening overcomes me, Worn down by ills and strife always, For every day Thou hast allowed me, Happily the farmer returns from ploughing, Bidding the gathering darkness good-day, So happy are we after all our toiling That the day will end without delay. O Joy when now all grief is banned, The pilgrimage is long forgotten, And unite my heart and aim Still welcoming us, that blessed night, In which the stars with beauteous light And heavenly hosts with one glad voice He who leads us through this earthly vale, He whose love for us will never fail, He has pledged His Love and a faithful hand Burning centre of our longing, Comforter of troubled minds, Jesus, hymns of our thanksgiving Praise Thy fervent love that binds. From Heaven above Thou wouldst be sent To Earth, tainted and torn apart, And take upon Thyself the debt Love for Thee is our whole being, Thou who art our highest good, For Thy Cross gives life its meaning, Eternally rejoice we should. O how much to Thee we’re bound, Jesus, Saviour, God’s own son, Our hearts and voices do resound Ensure that for us, too, that hour is nearing Of calling, of mercy, and seriousness, That in our hearts the voice we are hearing Psalm 42 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday. Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted in me? Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar. Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life. I will say unto God my rock, why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God? Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. If thou art wretched, shamed, perplexed, Then do not sin, renounce thy will Speak to thyself and mend thy ways Though many ask in desperation Who will shew us any good? Lord, after fearful lamentation, Show us the sweet light of Thy face Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. Psalm 25 What you are now, I used to be,  Amen.

She views this text as ‘the strongest evidence to date of an evangelical religious conversion’ and ‘a personal testimony of faith’ (p. 210), and argues that Vincent ‘is urging Theo to make a kind of evangelical “decision” to follow Christ, just as he had done’ (p. 213). Powers Erickson printed an incomplete version of the text, in which several quotations as well as statements made by Van Gogh are missing. That Vincent is seeking comfort in religion and using God’s words to appeal to Him are the defining elements of this prayer; at the same time, Vincent is attempting to give Theo the courage to decide what he really feels for this woman. And that my soul, In the silent night, Your voice did hear, So tender, so soft! (En dat mijn ziele, Ter stille nacht, Uw stem wel hoorde, Zoo teêr, zoo zacht!) See De Génestet 1869, vol. 1, p. 344.

That might be good – oh, old boy, how deeply I love those cities, that’s to say I love much of what one meets with there, there’s also much that I hate – or at least don’t love as much as the hedges of thorn-bush and the green grass and the little grey churches. What you’re thinking of is not bad at all. Your most loving brother Vincent Holland’s fate lay within the walls of Leiden; the eyes of all the provinces were on that heroic city, but the citadel was so strongly blockaded that it was very difficult to come to its aid. At last, the Prince of Orange resolved to breach the dykes. It was a desperate decision. Nevertheless, the old Batavian proverb held good: Better a devastated land than one that is lost. And so the land was devastated by the waters and the crops engulfed. The sea, that natural enemy of Holland, came to Leiden’s aid, but it was slow in coming. The wind did not carry the flood with it. On those lazy waves, which fell far short of the city, there appeared boats bearing cannons. These boats, which had neither oars nor sails, and moved by means of wheels, were manned by fearsome Zeeland sailors, almost all of them wounded in the war for independence. They were men of savage mien, most of them disfigured by terrible but honourable wounds. They came in order to offer the ruined city the example and the counsel of desperate resistance. The besieged citizens could see the flotilla from the top of their ramparts, and they could speak with the crews, but impeded by a north-easterly wind, the water retreated instead of advancing, and carried hope away with it: the very walls were shaken. The enemy, on the other hand, although driven from certain advanced positions by the overflowing of these waters, still held its ground on the principal dykes. Leiden appeared lost, when the moon, just then becoming full, swelled the mass of the waters. The wind veered to the south-west. One of those violent, unremitting storms which, in ordinary times, cause such acute alarms for the country’s safety, broke upon the coasts. The sea, being no longer held back, enlarged the breaches already made in the dykes and flung itself upon the land, carrying before it terror, desolation and salvation. Taken by surprise and overwhelmed, rigid with terror at the extraordinary noise of the tempest and of the collapse of parts of the walls, the Spaniards abandoned their posts amid great commotion, throwing their cannons into the water. The same tide that carried them away brought the Zeeland fleet, loaded with provisions, to the gates of Leiden. A tremendous battle, an Amphibious battle, to borrow a Dutch historian’s expression, was engaged amongst the branches of trees, partly on the dykes and partly in the boats. The liberating sailors entered the city, but in the midst of the joy, how sad a sight presented itself to their eyes! On both banks of the great canal exhausted men cried out for provisions. With the avidity of animals they seized the bread and herrings that were handed out to them, and several of them who had survived famine succumbed to this food. This deliverance seemed to have something of the miraculous. The formidable Spanish army – attacked, drowned, scattered inland by the waters of the sea, which appeared to be guided by an unseen hand – had vanished like the army of Pharaoh. This sudden rout seemed to reveal the direct favour of God, who now loved the Netherlands as he had once loved Israel; chroniclers even tell how a young Dutch woman, Madeleine Moons, raised, no doubt, in the traditions of the Old Testament, had made the siege drag on, using her charms to distract the heart of Valdez, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish army. And here is a graver fact. Detained by an illness, the Prince of Orange had not been able to appear in person before the walls of Leiden. He was in Delft, and barely recovered, was listening to the sermon at one of the city’s churches, when they came to bring him the happy news of the lifting of the siege. He had the message passed to the preacher, who read it out. Tears flowed from all eyes, together with thanksgivings. Although the plague was still claiming victims in that unhappy city of Leiden, William the Silent hesitated not a moment in going there. Surrounded by the citizenry, who forgot their woes on seeing in this man the living fortress of liberty regained, he asked them which they preferred, exemption from certain taxes, or the foundation of a Protestant university. The citizens of Leiden did not waver in their choice, ‘A University’ was the general cry. This academy was established on February 9 1575. And so a great political idea protected such an institution, which would provide a focus for the intellectual movement of the Batavian Reformation. To found by force of arms the material independence of the United Provinces was not all; a national moral identity had also to be created. Alphonse Esquiros Alphonse Esquiros Holland’s coasts are hidden by ranges of dunes that deprive the traveller of the sight of the waters. After a long and arduous climb up these sandy hills, raise your eyes, and there’s the sea! This North Sea was poorly known to the ancients, who imagined it in terms of fables and superstitious terrors. Even Tacitus pictured it as being churned up by constant winds and inhabited by monsters. The fact is that its coasts are stormy, and its colour is variable; in the foreground it is a scummy yellow that looks like dirty washing water, further off, a weak green, and in the distance, a faded blue that blends into the wavy line of the sky. Here and there, great clouds cast their sombre shadows obliquely over this indistinct mirror. No rocks, no cliffs break the force of the waves: this sea rolls on its sandy bed, which it had made for itself and which it is constantly expanding. The physiognomy of Holland’s coasts varies very little: sand, and more sand, water and more water, sky and more sky. On these coasts, which give the impression of being limitless, there stand, between the mouth of the Maas and Den Helder, a number of fishing villages. The most interesting of these villages are Scheveningen and Katwijk. The beach at Scheveningen is frequented by bathers during the summer. At that time of year, a pretty village, linked with The Hague by a tree-lined road, and a promenade built of timber that disappears among the dunes, welcomes foreigners from every country. Here everything shows the effects of proximity to the Ocean. The church, which by no means lacks elegance, contains the enormous skull and a few vertebrae of a sperm whale that was cast up on the shore in a storm, in 1617. These silent fragments are like a commentary on these words of Job: ‘The monsters proclaim Thee, O Lord’. In the main street, which leads to the sea, are to be found several vendors of shellfish. This sea, whose voice can be heard, shows itself only when the traveller’s feet are almost at the water. The sudden delight of surprise, and the grandeur of the scene that then opens up, fully compensate for the gradation of effects found on other shores. A fishing fleet, whose smacks are beached on the sand, or riding at anchor, or scattered out at sea like the thoughts of the sea’s brain, associates the image of labour with historical memories. Here the Ocean must be proud of Holland and the Dutch; in 1673, De Ruyter defeated the English and French fleets within sight of Scheveningen.  This love of liberty even rubs off on their religious beliefs. As we have seen, all, or almost all, of the fishermen of the coast are Protestant; they acknowledge only two books that have the right to speak to them of God: the Bible and the sea. It appears that the Ocean exerts a moral and sanctifying effect on them. Drunkenness is rare among the fishermen of Scheveningen, but even those who drink Hollands gin to excess on land abstain from any form of intemperance when they are at sea. Swearing is unknown on board a boat.

      "  Amsterdam, 4 June 1877 My dear Theo, Have got a lot to do, so adieu, perhaps this evening I’ll write a few more words below. Accept in thought a handshake, and believe me Your most loving brother, Vincent  It did not take long for his family to fall from its position of wealth. He retired to a small estate which he owned in the Huntingdon fens. The poor, harsh, desolate surroundings of this watery region, the monotonous horizon, the filthy river, the overcast sky, the spindly trees, the few scattered cottages, the rude manners of the inhabitants were of a kind to concentrate and to darken the young man’s character. The souls of places seem to enter the souls of men; often from a barren, dreary region there emerges a lively, ardent and profound faith. As the place, so the man. The soul is a mirror first, and only then a seat of feeling. A family misfortune affected Cromwell during this period of ascendancy in his life, when we are surprised to see tears in the eyes of a man who had watched dry-eyed the ill-fated Charles I torn from his children’s arms to die. He lost his mother, aged ninety-four. She was this Elizabeth Stuart, blood-daughter of the kings whom her son had dethroned, a biblical woman, mother of a large family, the wellspring of their piety, the nursemaid of their virtues, the living inspiration of their passion for the religious liberty of their sect; while in the full possession of her faculties, she enjoyed earthly glory, but most of all the heavenly glory of the greatest of her sons, the Maccabeus of her faith. Cromwell, as he wielded supreme power, cherished and venerated her as the root of his heart and of his destiny. My Lord Protector’s mother, wrote Cromwell’s private secretary, Thurloe, in that year of 1654, died last night almost a century old. Moments before she expired, she asked for her son to be called to her bedside, and giving her blessing with her hand, she said to him ‘May the Lord constantly make the splendour of His face to shine upon you, my son! May He sustain you in all your adversities! May He make your strength equal to the great things the Highest has charged you to accomplish for the glory of His Holy name and for the salvation of His people! My dear son, she continued, emphasizing the name that was her glory in her last moments, my dear son, I leave my spirit and my heart with thee! Farewell! Farewell!’ And she fell back, says Thurloe, in her final slumber. Cromwell burst into tears like a man who seemed to have lost part of the light that illuminated him in his darkness. His mother who loved him as a son and venerated him as God’s elect, resided with him in the royal palace of Whitehall, but she lived in a bare, secluded apartment in the palace. Not wishing, she said, to appropriate unto herself and to her other children that glory to which the Lord had condemned her son, but which was no more than the temporary furnishings of an inn, to which she wished to attach neither her heart, nor the future existence of her family. Keen anxieties troubled her days and nights in that palace of kings, where she missed her rural farm in Wales. Cromwell gave his mother a queen’s funeral, a sign rather of filial piety than of ostentation. She was buried among the ashes of royalty and illustrious men, beneath the parvis of Westminster, that Saint Denis of Britain’s royal houses and great men. He was taken back to the palace of Whitehall, as though it had been decreed by Providence that he should die before the same window in the same palace where, at his wish, the scaffold of his victim, the king, had been erected ten years previously. Cromwell was never again to rise from the royal bed in which he was laid on his return to London. The things he did and said during his long illness have been misrepresented or interpreted a thousand times, at the will of those who had reason to seek revenge for his life or to enhance their own position through his death. A new, authentic and invaluable document, the notes taken unbeknownst to him, hour by hour and sigh by sigh, by the groom of his bedchamber, who was at his service day and night, makes us privy to his every word and thought. Words spoken at this hour of death are thought’s secrets. Death removes the mask from every face, and there is no hypocrisy beneath the raised hand of God. Lord, Thou art my witness that, if I desire to live, it is in order to glorify Thy name and to perform Thy works. It is terrible, he murmured three times in succession, to fall into the hands of the living God! Do you believe, he said to his chaplain, that man can ever lose the state of grace before God once he has been raised to it? No, replied the chaplain, the state of grace does not allow of the possibility of lapsing from it. ‘Well,’ replied Cromwell, ‘then I am happy, because I am sure that I have been in a perfect state of grace at a certain time in my life.’ All his problems were of the life to come, none of this present life. I am the least of men, he continued a moment later, but I have loved God, praised God, or rather, I am beloved of God! There was a moment when the crisis of his illness was believed to have passed, and when he believed it himself. Whitehall and its churches resounded with thanksgiving. This moment was brief; the fever doubled in intensity. He had days and nights of calm enfeeblement and of wandering delirium. On the morning of August 30th, one of the officers, looking out of the window, recognized Captain Ludlow, exiled from London, passing by. Cromwell, informed of Ludlow’s presence, became anxious about what was making him bold enough to show himself in the capital and to walk beneath his windows. He feared an outburst of republicanism, calculated to erupt as he breathed his last. He sent his son Richard to Ludlow to probe the republicans’ secret intention. Ludlow assured Richard that he had come to London on private business only, and that when he came he did not even know of the Protector’s illness. He promised to leave the same day. This is the same Ludlow who, banished as a regicide shortly after Cromwell’s death, departed to grow old and die, impenitent for that murder, at Vevay, on the shores of Lake Geneva, where his tomb may be seen. Reassured as to the republicans’ intentions, Cromwell concerned himself only with making his death holy. The groom of his bedchamber, who kept vigil over him, heard him uttering his last prayer aloud in disjointed verses. For his own edification, he made a note of the words as they escaped from the lips of the dying Protector, and imparted them to history long afterwards:  On the following day, the anniversary of the battles of Dunbar and Worcester, his greatest triumphs, the noise of military fanfares in celebration of these victories rose into his apartments. I should like, he cried, to live long enough to render similar service to this people, but my day is done. May God always be with His children! After a final night of agony and sleeplessness, he was asked if he wished to drink or to sleep. Neither to drink nor to sleep now, he replied, but to go speedily to my Father. At sunrise he lost the power of speech, but could be seen still praying in a low voice. The equinoctial gales, which had been blowing since the previous day, at that moment turned into a storm so violent that it resembled an earthquake. Carriages bringing to London the Protector’s friends, who had been warned of the extremity of his peril, could not make headway against the wind, and sought refuge at roadside inns. The tall London houses seemed to sway like ships on the waves. Roofs were carried away and centuries-old trees in Hyde Park torn up by the roots and swept along the ground, with all their leaves, like tufts of grass. Cromwell expired at two o’clock in the afternoon, in the midst of this upheaval of nature. The storm carried him off as it had brought him in. The people saw a wonder in this convulsion of the atmosphere with the final convulsion of their prophet.

There might be a human reason behind it, which one can indeed appreciate. I imagine that as long as he is not actually a student, that is until he hears that he has amounted to something, it could well hurt his feelings a bit to present himself now in The Hague to those who knew him before. If once he succeeds in passing an examination, thereby giving proof of actual competence, then he will feel that he has acquitted himself in the eyes of the public. I can understand that feeling to some extent ... I should like him to have a more cheerful tone and also hope that he won’t keep himself too aloof from normal life. He must also apply himself quite seriously to conversation. But I’d like to say to you: do not take it amiss and continue to help him, and if he cannot now decide to come and visit you, go and see him, if you can manage it. You would certainly be doing good, and do remain on an intimate footing with him. He has such urgent need of it. It is really a formidable task that he has taken upon himself, and it seems that he has started by applying himself to it with all seriousness and not without succesAmsterdam, 18 Aug. 1877. My dear Theo, A poor woodcutter, faggots piled upon his back And burdened by his load and sum of years, Groaning and bent low, made way with heavy tread And tried to reach his smoky cot. At last, by effort and by pain o’ercome He lays his burden down and dwells upon his sorry state. What pleasure has he known in all his days? Is there a poorer man in all this turning world? Hungry sometimes, and never knowing rest; His wife, his children, soldiery, taxation’s cut, Creditors and forced servitude Make of him misfortune’s very mould. He calls on Death. Death promptly comes, Asks what’s to be done. He says, to help me load this wood upon my back again You will not tarry long. Our passing comes, the cure for every ill, But let’s not shift from where we stand. Suffer sooner than die, Work, take pains, That’s the resource that fails the least. A wealthy farmer, feeling death was nigh, Summoned his children, spoke to them privily. Take care, he told them, and do not sell The inheritance our forebears handed down. A treasure is concealed therein. I know not the place, but some courage will suffice To bring you to it, and you’ll find it out. Plough your field as soon as the harvest is in. Dig, delve, turn up the earth, leave not a spot Where the hand pass not and pass again. Their father dead, the sons ploughed well the field, This way and that, in such a way that one year thence It brought back more In coin that was in no way hid. But the man was wise, In showing them, before his death, That work is wealth. The oak one day said unto the reed, You have good cause ’gainst nature to complain: To you a goldcrest is a heavy weight, The slightest wind that may perchance Make ripples on the water’s face Forces you to bow your head. Whereas my brow, just as the mighty Caucasus, Not only stops the sun’s hot rays But bids the storm do what it may. To you, each wind’s a northern blast, to me a gentle breeze. Had you but grown within the shelter of the leaves With which I cover all this place about Your suffering would be less; I would defend you ’gainst the tempest’s rage. But you most frequently are found On the damp edges of the windy realms, And nature seems to treat you ill indeed. Your pity, answered him the pliant shrub, Springs from your kindly heart, but have no care for me. To me, winds are less fearsome than they are to you, Against their dreadful buffetings You have held out; your back’s not bent, But let’s see how it ends; and as he spoke, From the far horizon furiously there came The fearfullest of all the brood The north had yet unleashed upon his flanks. The oak stood firm, the reed bent low. The wind blew harder and then harder still Until it pulled up by the very roots The one whose head reached heavenward, Whose feet stood near the kingdom of the dead.

Therefore remove heaviness from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.

Your loving brother Vincent After some days, all the miseries suffered by the Crusaders before the walls of Antioch were seen as trivial and mild compared with the woes they suffered within them. Hunger and thirst were beginning to harass them dreadfully. As long as there was any fodder left for the horses, they kept them to drink their blood; some days later, they found themselves forced to kill them, in order to feed on their flesh. Plants of whatever kind were avidly devoured. People ate the leaves of trees, and boiled animal skins. Even the dried leather from pieces of armour provided nourishment. Hunger lent this food an exquisite and delightful flavour. And it was not only the lowliest among the Crusaders who found themselves cast into this state of destitution; the same suffering made all men equal and brought all heads to the same level. Commanders, soldiers, women, maidens, all suffered together. The people bemoaned their hunger with loud cries, and none could assist another, nor escape the scourge. Even Godfrey found himself with no horses and no money. It is reported that several unhappy people dragged themselves, half dead from inanition, through the streets of the city, crying: ‘O Lord, may Thy name be blessed!’, and they consoled themselves in the hope that the sufferings of this life would have their reward in the next. But the same resignation did not hold sway throughout the army, and desertions recommenced; William the Carpenter, forgetting the oath he had made to remain true to the sacred cause, fled for a second time. Alexius Comnena, from whom help was expected, turned back on learning of the agonizing situation of the Christians of Antioch. Some hours after the return of Peter the Hermit, who had been sent to the infidels’ camp to order them to abandon the siege of Antioch and to give free passage to the Christians, and who had reported nothing but threatening words, a strange excitement was seen to seize the Christians, incensed at the haughty words of the Turkish commander. Their pale, defeated faces, their dull, lifeless eyes suddenly revived, and their bowed, wasted bodies stood up straight and proud. All was made ready for the battle that was to take place on the following day, and people prepared themselves with prayers and religious processions. It was the day of the feast of Saints Peter and Paul, and this circumstance increased still further the army’s courage. All the troops, with the exception of the Count of Toulouse and a small number of soldiers from Provence, who were left behind to hold the garrison of the Citadel, left Antioch and were drawn up in battle order on the plain that lay before the city. The advance guard was preceded by priests and monks carrying the Crucifix in their hands, calling aloud for Divine protection and crying out in the words of the Psalmist, ‘Be Thou a tower of strength to those who put their faith in Thee’. Every incident seemed to be a favourable omen, and even the morning dew, making the air fragrant with the scent of roses, was seen a mark of Heaven’s special favour. (And they won the fight.)

I’d really like very much for us to be together in Haarlem, write in any case when and for how long you could get leave. Bring as many of your prints as you can, even if I know them, I’d still like to see them again. That which pleases God the most Your loving brother Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b134 V/1962Amsterdam, 9 Dec. 1877 My dear Theo, I feel the need to write to you without waiting too long, the reason being first of all that I must thank you for three things. First of all, for your excellent four-page letter, with which you gave me the greatest pleasure, because it does one good to feel that a brother of his also walks and lives on earth, when one has a lot of things to think about and a lot to do, one sometimes gets the feeling, where am I? what am I doing? where am I going? — and one starts to grow dizzy — but then such a familiar voice, or rather familiar handwriting, makes one feel firm ground beneath one’s feet again, as it were.  It’s always a nice walk to that Eilandskerk. This afternoon I took another walk around the little English church with those maps of those rocky countries, because I had a feeling that they were connected with that little church. It’s a good plan of yours to write those names etc. on the map of Brittany. Bring it along at Christmas, you know that I did that on the one I drew, then we can compare them. Be sure and do it, for that is good. It was such wonderful weather today, and so beautiful among those thorn-hedges by the little church when night began to fall. Now I have to hurry, for I have to get to work. So in all likelihood I’ll be coming to The Hague next week for a day, Thursday say, possibly later, I have to see how it fits in best with my work. From The Hague I hope to go to Dordrecht, and if it turns out that you can leave Saturday evening, we’ll meet each other at the station in Dordrecht. I wish you the very best and blessings in your work. You’ll be busy, but actually one should be grateful for pressure and effort and all suchlike things more than for anything else, for it is only by long training in that that one develops. I sincerely hope that you’ll be able to leave Saturday, because at home they’d surely like us to be in Etten the Sunday before Christmas. So goodbye for now, if I hear nothing more from you I’ll come on Thursday or Friday, 20 or 21 December.

I sincerely hope that you’ve had a good Sunday. Your loving brother Vincent Good-night, old boy, I sat up writing till 12 o’clock, a handshake in thought.

I feel the need to do something like that now and then, for it’s most certainly in doubt whether I’ll pass, i.e. all of the requirements, 5 years at the least is a long time, if one begins younger then one succeeds much more easily. Though I can work more and am better able to keep clear from distractions, and I have no desire for those things which many another craves, even so, I notice that I have difficulty learning. And in case I don’t pass, I want nevertheless to be sure of having left a sign of life here and there. Your most loving brother Vincent Tuesday morning. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b139 V/19Amsterdam, 3 March 1878 My dear Theo, It’s time to write to you again, how I should like to have been with you today, it was such beautiful weather here, and one feels that spring is coming. In the country one would probably have been able to hear a lark, but that’s difficult in the city, unless one notices the sounds of the lark’s song in the voice of some old minister whose words come from a heart tuned like a lark’s. Couldn’t you say a bit in advance when you’ll be coming? I’ll count on it, then, by working ahead a little so we can spend some time together. Adieu, a handshake in thought, and believe me Your loving brother Vincent Bid your housemates good-day from me.

The ray from on high doesn’t always shine on us, and is sometimes behind the clouds, and without that light a person cannot live and is worth nothing and can do nothing good, and anyone who maintains that one can live without faith in that higher light and doesn’t worry about attaining it will end up being disappointed. We’ve talked quite a lot about what we feel to be our duty and how we should arrive at something good, and we rightly came to the conclusion that first of all our goal must be to find a certain position and a profession to which we can devote ourselves entirely. And I think that we also agreed on this point, namely that one must pay special attention to the end, and that a victory achieved after lifelong work and effort is better than one achieved more quickly. As far as I’m concerned, I must become a good minister, who has something to say that is good and can be useful in the world, and perhaps it’s good after all that I have a relatively long time of preparation and become secure in a firm conviction before I’m called upon to speak about it to others. It is wise, before one begins that work, to gather together a wealth of things that could benefit others. If one were to say but few words, though ones with meaning, one would do better than to say many that were only empty sounds, and just as easy to utter as they were of little use.

Theo, now on his sales trip for Goupil, planned his visit to Amsterdam to coincide with Vincent’s birthday on 30 March (FR b973 and b974). Mr van Gogh asked Theo for his impression of Vincent: ‘We think it strange that we have had no letter from him, not even after his birthday. He doesn’t write as regularly as he used to. I do so fear that he feels very unhappy in himself, but what can one do about it? We encourage him, and give him the opportunity to continue his studies, even though we hardly know how we shall manage. It’s a sickly existence that he has made for himself, I’m afraid, and how much he will still have to struggle, and we with him. Tell us whether you visited him and how you found him’ (FR b973, 1 April 1878Amsterdam, May 1878 My dear Theo, It can be so glorious in Paris in the autumn, well, you’ll be seeing something of it at the end of September.

Now, old boy, I’m writing to you by the light of a lantern and the candle is becoming very short, adieu, I wish you well; if you can, write a few words with something about the painters, and if you hear something interesting about this or that, but better still would be your own impressions of whatever you like.

Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b145 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘Etten 15 Aug 1878My dear Theo, That little drawing, ‘The Au charbonnage café’ is really nothing special, but the reason I couldn’t help making it is because one sees so many coalmen, and they really are a remarkable people. This little house is not far from Trekweg, it’s actually a simple inn right next to the big workplace where the workers come in their free time to eat their bread and drink a glass of beer. How much there is in art that is beautiful, if only one can remember what one has seen, one is never empty or truly lonely, and never alone. Your loving brother Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b146 V/1962 (sheet 1) and inv. no. d293 V/1970 (sheet 2) He has not yet given any details about those classes. I am rather curious. He writes that he still feels like a cat in a strange warehouse. It could hardly be otherwise! May this lead to something lasting, however’  (FR b2437). A month later Mr van Gogh was less optimistic. Vincent’s social ineptness prompted him to remark sceptically: ‘Is it any wonder that we worry? Oh, how much we worry still about Vincent! He appears not to want to shed that eccentricity, regards his clothing and appearance as well, and it will, I think, make things impossible for him. I do not hear others’ opinion of him and I can’t bring myself to ask about it again. His letters do contain interesting news, but will he reach his goal?’ (FR b2440, to Theo, 14 October 1878).Petit-Wasmes, 26 Dec. 1878 My dear Theo, It’s time I write to you again, first of all to wish you happiness at the beginning of a new year. May much good be your share, and God’s blessing be on your work in this year that we’re beginning. Just as in Brabant we have the copse and the oak wood, and in Holland the pollard willows, so here one sees those black thorn-bushes around the gardens, fields and land. The recent snow gave it the effect of letters written on white paper, like the pages of the gospel. May it come to pass with God’s blessing that I be placed here permanently somewhere; I should sincerely wish it. Write soon when you have the time, and remember that you are repeatedly, even constantly, in my thoughts. Wishing again that God’s best blessings may be your share in the new year, and shaking your hand in thought, believe me ever Your most loving brother Vincent I just visited an old mother in a charcoal-burner’s family. She’s seriously ill, but pious and patient. I read a chapter to her and prayed with all of them. The people here have something special and appealing because of their simplicity and kind-heartedness, just like the Brabanters in Zundert and Etten.

So now we are relieved inasmuch as he has good accommodation for the present – and otherwise we’ll wait and see. Especially now that it’s so wintry, we’re glad that he has initially ended up there, and in that colliery country there will certainly be no lack of opportunity to warm oneself. Accordingly, he writes that in his room, too, he has a fire in the grate, and clothing, and simple but healthy fare’ (FR b2448). The above-mentioned ‘Rev. Péron’ is Pierre Péron, who worked for the Eglise protestante unie de Belgique from 1869 to 1882. The minutes of 15 April 1879 report the situation to date: ‘Attention is drawn to Mr Vincent and his work. The details, both regrettable and encouraging, that have been given persuade the committee to authorise the Hainaut sub-committee to extend Mr Vincent van Gogh’s trial period for three [months], if it sees fit .’ (L’attention est attirée sur M. Vincent et sur son oeuvre. Les détails à la fois regrettables et encourageants qui sont donnés déterminent le comité à autoriser le sous-comité du Hainaut à prolonger l’essai de M. Vincent van Gogh pendant trois [mois], s’il le juge bon’) [p. 177]. (Brussels, Archives of the Eglise protestante unie de Belgique). Cf. also Lutjeharms 1978, p. 10My dear Theo, It’s been a long time since I wrote to you. If, with God’s blessing, I succeed in getting settled here, then you must come here sometime, perhaps when you have to go to Paris again, or tying it in with a business trip. Write a few words soon, and remember that if you tell me about the painters, I still understand something of it, even though it’s been a long time since I’ve seen many paintings. I have to go out and visit the sick as well as the healthy. Write soon, and I wish you the very best. Adieu, a handshake in thought, and believe me ever Your loving brother Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b148 V/19Wasmes, April 1879 My dear Theo, These days you’ll no doubt be in the dunes and in Scheveningen now and then. Here it’s also attractive in the country in the spring; here and there are places where one could imagine oneself in the dunes, because of the hills. I went on a very interesting excursion not long ago; the fact is, I spent 6 hours in a mine. Had a good guide, a man who has already worked there for 33 years, a friendly and patient man who explained everything clearly and tried to make it understandable. We went down together, 700 metres deep this time, and went into the most hidden corners of that underworld. The arrangement is more or less like the cells in a beehive, or like a dark, sombre passageway in an underground prison, or like a series of small looms, or actually they look like a row of ovens such as one sees among the peasants, or like the separate tombs in a vault. The passageways themselves are like the large chimneys of the Brabant farmsteads. The villages here have something forsaken and still and extinct about them, because life goes on underground instead of above. One could be here for years, but unless one has been down in the mines one has no clear picture of what goes on here. Have you seen anything beautiful recently? I’m eagerly longing for a letter from you. A couple of nights ago a foal was born in the stable here, a nice small creature that was quick to stand firmly on its feet. The workers keep a lot of goats here, and there are young ones in the houses everywhere, just like the rabbits commonly to be found in the workers’ houses. Must go out and visit the sick, so have to finish now, let me hear from you soon, to give a sign of life, should you have the time. Your loving brother Vincent Going down in a mine is an unpleasant business, in a kind of basket or cage like a bucket in a well, but then a well 500-700 metres deep, so that down there, looking upward, the daylight appears to be about as big as a star in the sky. One has a feeling similar to one’s first time on a ship at sea, but worse, though fortunately it doesn’t last long. The workers get used to it, but even so, they never shake off an unconquerable feeling of horror and dread that stays with them, not without reason or unjustifiably. Once down there, however, it isn’t so bad, and the effort is richly rewarded by what one sees. Address Vincent van Gogh rue du Petit-Wasmes Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b149 V/19Wasmes, June 1879 My dear Theo, Lately made the acquaintance of someone who supervised the workers for years. Is of humble origins but worked his way up. Now he has a chest complaint, quite serious, and can no longer stand the terribly exhausting work down in the mine. It’s very important to hear him talk about the subject. He has always remained the workmen’s friend (in contrast to many others who worked their way up, not because of true distinction but because of money, driven by motives less noble and many times more base). He has a labourer’s heart, true and honest and courageous, but is far above most of them as regards intellectual development. On more than one occasion during a strike, he was the only person who could exert any influence on the workers. Even talks about coming over here sometime in the autumn to discuss the matter. I truly wish that such a thing may come to pass. Blessings on your work, and believe me ever Your loving brother Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b150 V/19Cuesmes, 5 Aug. 1879 My dear Theo, I’m writing to you in haste. Won’t you be going to Paris quite soon now? If so, write and tell me which day and what time, and in all likelihood I’ll see you at the station. If you have time to stay here for a day, or longer or shorter, I sincerely wish that this could happen. Am at the following address at the moment There have been a lot of storms here lately. Come on, old chap, if you can arrange it, come and stay over till the next train. Adieu, accept a handshake in thought, and believe me ever Yours truly, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b151 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘Cuesmes 5 Aug 1879’. The evangelization committee, whose demands he had failed to meet, had given him three months to look for another situation. He was judged to be lacking in several qualities necessary to perform his duties, namely the ability to speak eloquently and to organize meetings at which the community could be uplifted by hearing the message of the gospel. Van Gogh’s successor, Hutton, would succeed within two months in turning around the deteriorating situation, as emerges from the minutes of a meeting of the church council of Wasmes: ‘The trial made in accepting the services of a young Dutchman, Mr Vincent Van Gogh, who believed himself called to evangelize in the Borinage, has not yielded the expected results. If to the admirable qualities he displayed among the sick and injured, to the devotion and spirit of sacrifice of which he furnished many demonstrations, watching with them at night and divesting himself for them of most of his clothes and linen, had been added a gift for speaking, indispensable to anyone placed at the head of a congregation, Mr van Gogh would certainly have been an accomplished evangelist. It would not, of course, be reasonable to ask for extraordinary talents. But it is a fact that the absence of certain qualities may render the performance of the evangelist’s primary function totally deficient. Unfortunately, that was the case with Mr van Gogh. Therefore, once the trial period had expired, we were obliged to abandon the idea of keeping him longer. The evangelist currently employed, Mr Hutton, took up his post on 1 October 1879. The work he has done so far is extensive and has already borne fruit. L’évangéliste actuellement à l’oeuvre, M. Hutton, a pris possession de sa charge le 1er octobre 1879. Son activité jusqu’ici a été grande et a déjà porté des fruits. M. Hutton a rétabli à Warquignies la réunion qui avait été inaugurée par M. Péron et était tombée sous M. Van Gogh. Mais son abandon parait l’avoir sérieusement compromise, car elle se soutient avec peine.) In his recollections of the l’Eglise Protestante of Petit-Wasmes, the chronicler Antoine Denis remarked that Van Gogh was ‘losing his mind [and] becoming ... a responsibility’ (perdait la tête [et] devenait ... une charge). (An extract from the archives of this church was kindly supplied by minister Ruben Quenon in 1973; a copy of the manuscript is to be found in the Dossier Pièrre Secretan-Rollier, Amsterdam, Vincent van Gogh Foundation). Vincent’s parents saw no way out of the situation, and Mr van Gogh complained to Theo: ‘We are sorely tried by this and are literally at our wits’ end’ (FR b2487, 19 July). In Brussels he visited the various families he had become acquainted with there. What kind of impression will he have made? Like a ?.... Oh, we can imagine almost anything! His letter was written in a rather cheerful tone – mixed with bitterness. Tomorrow it will be ten years since he left our house and I brought him to The Hague to work in Goupil’s firm. What troubles we’ve had since! ... We are tired and all but despondent ... I wrote this morning to Vincent and to others in his behalf. In the main I do not object to or condemn what he is doing. I think it best to leave him to his own devices, but we watch him with trepidation and remain ready to come to his aid if necessary. We invited him to come home, but he definitely doesn’t want that’ (FR b2488My dear Theo, A prisoner who’s kept in isolation, who’s prevented from working &c., would in the long run, especially if this were to last too long, suffer the consequences just as surely as one who went hungry for too long. Like everyone else, I have need of relationships of friendship or affection or trusting companionship, and am not like a street pump or lamp-post, whether of stone or iron, so that I can’t do without them without perceiving an emptiness and feeling their lack, like any other generally civilized and highly respectable man — and I tell you these things to let you know what a salutary effect your visit had on me. As I think back on your visit with thankfulness, our talks naturally come to mind. I’ve heard such talks before, many, in fact, and often. Plans for improvement and change and raising the spirits — and yet, don’t let it anger you, I’m a little afraid of them — also because I sometimes acted upon them and ended up rather disappointed. How much has been well thought out that is, however, impracticable. And if you should now assume from what I’ve said that I intended to say you were a quack because of your advice then you will have completely misunderstood me, since I have no such idea or opinion of you. But, you say, I’m not giving you this advice for you to follow to the letter, but because I thought you had a taste for idling and because I was of the opinion that you should put an end to it. And, joking apart, I honestly think it would be better if the relationship between us were more trusting on both sides. If I must seriously feel that I’m annoying or burdensome to you or those at home, useful for neither one thing nor another, and were to go on being forced to feel like an intruder or a fifth wheel in your presence, so that it would be better I weren’t there, and if I should have to continue trying to keep further and further out of other people’s way — if I think that indeed it would be so and cannot be otherwise, then I’m overcome by a feeling of sorrow and I must struggle against despair. It’s difficult for me to bear these thoughts and more difficult still to bear the thought that so much discord, misery and sorrow, in our midst and in our family, has been caused by me. If it were indeed so, then I’d truly wish that it be granted me not to have to go on living too long. Yet whenever this depresses me beyond measure, all too deeply, after a long time the thought also occurs to me: it’s perhaps only a bad, terrible dream, and later we’ll perhaps learn to understand and comprehend it better. But is it not, after all, reality, and won’t it one day become better rather than worse? To many it would no doubt appear foolish and superstitious to believe in any improvement for the better. Sometimes in winter it’s so bitterly cold that one says, it’s simply too cold, what do I care whether summer comes, the bad outweighs the good. But whether we like it or not, an end finally comes to the hard frost, and one fine morning the wind has turned and we have a thaw. Comparing the natural state of the weather with our state of mind and our circumstances, subject to variableness and change, I still have some hope that it can improve. Walked to Wasmes after your departure that evening. Have since drawn a portrait. Adieu, accept in thought a handshake, and believe me Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b152 V/19My dear Theo, And so it’s to thank you for it that I’m writing to you. In the first place, then, I’d like to see this good understanding, to say no more, re-established between my father and me, and I would also be very keen that it be re-established between the two of us. Good understanding is infinitely better than misunderstanding. I must now bore you with certain abstract things; however, I’d like you to listen to them patiently. Good — now I no longer have those surroundings — however, that something that’s called soul, they claim that it never dies and that it lives for ever and seeks for ever and for ever and for evermore. And now for as much as 5 years, perhaps, I don’t know exactly, I’ve been more or less without a position, wandering hither and thither. Now you say, from such and such a time you’ve been going downhill, you’ve faded away, you’ve done nothing. Is that entirely true? It’s true that sometimes I’ve earned my crust of bread, sometimes some friend has given me it as a favour; I’ve lived as best I could, better or worse, as things went; it’s true that I’ve lost several people’s trust, it’s true that my financial affairs are in a sorry state, it’s true that the future’s not a little dark, it’s true that I could have done better, it’s true that just in terms of earning my living I’ve lost time, it’s true that my studies themselves are in a rather sorry and disheartening state, and that I lack more, infinitely more than I have. But is that called going downhill, and is that called doing nothing? Perhaps you’ll say, but why didn’t you continue as people would have wished you to continue, along the university road?  But what’s your ultimate goal, you’ll say. That goal will become clearer, will take shape slowly and surely, as the croquis becomes a sketch and the sketch a painting, as one works more seriously, as one digs deeper into the originally vague idea, the first fugitive, passing thought, unless it becomes firm. This state of affairs has its bad side for someone who doesn’t agree with all that, and who protests against it with all his heart and with all his soul and with all the indignation of which he is capable. Myself, I respect academicians who are not like those academicians, but the respectable ones are more thinly scattered than one would believe at first glance. Now one of the reasons why I’m now without a position, why I’ve been without a position for years, it’s quite simply because I have different ideas from these gentlemen who give positions to individuals who think like them. It’s not a simple matter of appearance, as people have hypocritically held it against me, it’s something more serious than that, I assure you. Someone will make a deep study of the history of the French Revolution — he will not be an unbeliever, he will see that in great things, too, there is a sovereign power that manifests itself. Try to understand the last word of what the great artists, the serious masters, say in their masterpieces; there will be God in it. Someone has written or said it in a book, someone in a painting. And quite simply read the Bible, and the Gospels, because that will give you something to think about, and a great deal to think about and everything to think about, well then, think about this great deal, think about this everything, it raises your thinking above the ordinary level, despite yourself. Since we know how to read, let’s read, then! I’m writing you somewhat at random whatever comes into my pen; I would be very happy if you could somehow see in me something other than some sort of idler. Because there are idlers and idlers, who form a contrast. An idle man like that resembles an idle bird like that. And it’s often impossible for men to do anything, prisoners in I don’t know what kind of horrible, horrible, very horrible cage. There is also, I know, release, belated release. A reputation ruined rightly or wrongly, poverty, inevitability of circumstances, misfortune; that creates prisoners. You may not always be able to say what it is that confines, that immures, that seems to bury, and yet you feel I know not what bars, I know not what gates — walls. Is all that imaginary, a fantasy? I don’t think so; and then you ask yourself, Dear God, is this for long, is this for ever, is this for eternity? You know, what makes the prison disappear is every deep, serious attachment. To be friends, to be brothers, to love; that opens the prison through sovereign power, through a most powerful spell. But he who doesn’t have that remains in death. But where sympathy springs up again, life springs up again. And the prison is sometimes called Prejudice, misunderstanding, fatal ignorance of this or that, mistrust, false shame. But if it became possible for you to see in me something other than an idler of the bad kind, I would be very pleased about that. And if I could ever do something for you, be useful to you in some way, know that I am at your service. Since I’ve accepted what you gave me, you could equally ask me for something if I could be of service to you in some way or another; it would make me happy and I would consider it a sign of trust. We’re quite distant from one another, and in certain respects we may have different ways of seeing, but nevertheless, sometime or some day one of us might be able to be of use to the other. For today, I shake your hand, thanking you again for the kindness you’ve shown me. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b153 a-b V/1962 On 25 June 1880, Theo wrote to his parents, saying that he had received a letter from Vincent. Their reaction to what Theo told them reveals that the letter in question must be the present one, which must therefore have been written several days previously (FR b2494 and b2495, Mr and Mrs van Gogh to Theo, 5 July 1880). An analysis of the structure of this letter appears in Pollock 1980, pp. 624-630; cf. also Pollock and Orton 1978, pp. 7-10, and exhib. cat. Amsterdam 1980, pp. 21-27. Van Gogh names the Haarlem Museum as the place where he saw this portrait, though before 1880 it had no Fabritius (not even on loan), and the portrait in Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen – still housed at the time in the Schielandshuis – was, as far as we know, never lent to another museum. This could mean that Vincent and Theo had once gone to Rotterdam, or else that they saw, in Haarlem, another portrait that is no longer attributed to FabritiusCuesmes, 20 August 1880 Dear Theo, Send me what you can, and don’t have any fears on my account. If only I can go on working, I’ll recover somehow. But you’d be a great help to me by doing this. If you pay a visit to Holland sooner or later, I hope you won’t pass by without coming to see the scratches. I’m writing to you while drawing and I’m in a hurry to get back to it, so good-night, and send the sheets as soon as possible, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent rue du Pavillon 3 I’d very much like to execute the drawing in question better than I have done. In the one that I’ve done, as it stands, the figures might be about 10 centimetres high. The pendant is of the miners’ return, but it’s less successful as it stands. It’s very difficult, as it involves an effect of brown silhouettes encircled by light against a streaky sunset sky.

You did me a great service by sending them. For today, I’ll end this letter by thanking you again and shaking your hand. Vincent 3 rue du Pavillon Cuesmes (near Mons) The Sower. Evening prayer Labours of the fields, 10 sheets Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b155 V/19Cuesmes, 24 Sept. 1880 Dear Theo, Your letter did me good; I thank you for writing to me like that. You can see, then, that I’m working like mad, but for the moment it isn’t giving very heartening results. But I have hopes that these thorns will bear white flowers in their time, and that this apparently sterile struggle is nothing other than a labour of giving birth. First pain, then joy afterwards. Another thing that I saw during that excursion was the weavers’ villages. In your letter you spoke to me vaguely about coming to Paris or the surrounding area. Sooner or later, when it would be possible and when I felt like it. Of course, it would be my great and ardent desire to come either to Paris or to Barbizon or somewhere else. But how could I do it, because I don’t earn a sou, and although I work hard it’ll take more time yet to reach the level of being able to think of such a thing as coming to Paris. Because in truth, to be able to work as one should, it would take at least about a hundred francs a month; you can live on less, but then you’re hard up, far too much so in fact. For the moment I can’t see how the thing would be practicable, and it’s better that I stay here, working as I can and will be able to, and after all, it’s cheaper to live here. So I would like simply to take a little workman’s house; that costs 9 francs a month on average. If I’m doing the wrong thing, the fault is mine. But one can very certainly find more easily at Barbizon than elsewhere, if one perhaps were to have this happy encounter, the opportunity to fall in with some more advanced artist who would be for me truly a Heaven-sent angel, let it be said seriously and without any exaggeration. So if, sometime, you were to see means and opportunity, think of me; while waiting I’ll stay quietly in some little workman’s house, where I’ll work as best I can. Thanking you for your kindness, chiefly for The bush, I shake your hand. Vincent I’ve taken all your collection now, but you’ll have it back later, and in addition, for your collection of wood engravings, which I hope you’re continuing, I have some very good things in the 2 volumes of the Musée Universel, which I intend for you. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b156 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘Cuesmes le 24 sept. 1880Dear Theo, For a long time now I haven’t seen enough paintings or drawings &c., and the mere sight of a few good things here in Brussels has raised my morale, so to speak, and has further increased the desire that I have to learn to do something with my own hands. So if you would write him a short line by return of post you’d be doing me a great service and it would save time. But my goal must, for the moment at least, remain to learn as quickly as possible to do presentable and saleable drawings, so that I’ll begin to earn an income directly through my work. Because such indeed is the necessity that is imposed upon me. I believe that you’ll approve of what I’m telling you, because in order to make progress it’s necessary to continue with a certain amount of energy. Once I am master of my pencil or of watercolour or of etching, I can return to the region of the miners or weavers, to do things better from life than thus far. But first I must acquire a modicum of skill. Well then, I conclude for the moment, hoping that you’ll be in agreement with what I’ve told you. I believe that a lodging and perhaps also a diet slightly better than that of the Borinage will also help to build me up a bit. Because I’ve certainly experienced some sufferings in the Belgian ‘black country’, and my health hasn’t been too good lately. But provided that I succeed one day in being able actually to draw what I wish to express, I’ll forget all that and will remember only the good aspect of things, which also exists if one is willing to observe it. But I must nevertheless try to build myself up a little, because I need all my energy. Shaking your hand Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b157 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘Bruxelles 15 Oct. 1880Brussels, 1 Nov. 72 blvd du Midi My dear Theo, I want to tell you a few things in reply to your letter. And what I’m now going to do is complete the drawing of the muscles, i.e. that of the torso and legs, which will form the whole of the human body with what’s already made. Then there’s still the body seen from the back and from the side. So you see that I’m pushing ahead with a vengeance, those things aren’t so very easy, and require time and moreover quite a bit of patience. I believe that this will also be your point of view. Drawing is a hard and difficult struggle. In Cuesmes, old boy, I couldn’t have stood it a month longer without falling ill with misery. You mustn’t think that I live in luxury here, for my food consists mainly of dry bread and some potatoes or chestnuts which people sell on the street corners, but I’ll manage very well with a slightly better room and by eating a slightly better meal from time to time in a restaurant if that were possible. But for nearly 2 years I endured one thing and another in the Borinage, that’s no pleasure trip. But it will easily amount to something more than 60 francs and really can’t be otherwise. Drawing materials and examples, for instance, for anatomy, it all costs money, and those are certainly essentials, and only in this way can it pay off later, otherwise I’ll never succeed. I would have written to you sooner but was too busy with my skeleton. I believe that the longer you think about it the more you’ll see the definite necessity of more artistic surroundings for me, for how is one supposed to learn to draw unless someone shows you? With the best will in the world one cannot succeed without also coming into and remaining in contact with artists who are already further along. Good will is of no avail if there’s absolutely no opportunity for development. As regards mediocre artists, to whose ranks you think I should not want to belong, what shall I say? That depends on what one calls mediocre. I’ll do what I can, but in no way do I despise the mediocre in its simple sense. And one certainly doesn’t rise above that level by despising that which is mediocre, in my opinion one must at least begin by having some respect for the mediocre as well, and by knowing that that, too, already means something and that one doesn’t achieve even that without much effort. Adieu for today, I shake your hand in thought. Write again soon if you can. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b158 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘Bruxelles 1 Nov. / 72 Boulev du Midi’. The emphasis Van Gogh places on the report that Van Rappard ‘now lives’ at rue Traversière (Dwarsstraat) 64, in the St Joost-ten-Noode district in the east of Brussels, suggests that Theo did not know his current address. Cf. exhib. cat. Amsterdam 1974, pp. 11 (with a different house number), 59 and 6My dear fellow, Since for so long, several months in fact, I’ve had no news from you, not even the smallest response to my last letter, perhaps it won’t be an inappropriate moment to ask you for some sign of life.  Because, my very dear, let’s be careful, let’s not spin our thread too fine; you know, it could become too fragile. When thinking of you, I can’t help saying to myself: Why doesn’t he write? If he’s afraid of compromising himself vis à vis those Messrs G&Cie by keeping in touch with me, is his position in regard to the aforementioned gents so unsteady and shaky that he would be obliged to be as chary of himself as that? And if he was afraid of compromising himself in one way or another, why not warn me with a brief line and I wouldn’t write to him, but now I don’t know where I stand. Or is it because he’s afraid that I would ask him for money? But then, if that was the reason for your silence, you could at least have waited to be silent at the time when somebody tried to squeeze something out of you, as the saying goes. However, I don’t wish to lengthen this letter unnecessarily by making you a list of heaps of things that come into my head at times when I think about the reasons you could have had for not writing. I’ve been drawing this winter until now, and have also read a great deal, because indirectly that’s very necessary for me. In general I believe that I’ve made progress, but it ought to be possible to get on faster than that. And yet I very much wish to find one who, knowing more than me, could help me to do better. So tell me if you saw an insuperable obstacle in the way of my going to The Hague for a while, and if you perhaps knew of another way, if something crops up. I shake your hand, in the expectation that you’ll write to me sooner rather than later. Vincent 72. boulevard du Midi Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b159 V/19Brussels, January 81. My dear Theo, You will entirely forgive me when you realize that I wrote you my last letter at a bad time. My drawings weren’t going well, and not knowing which way to turn I began to write. I would certainly have done better to have waited for a better moment, but this way you’ll clearly see that without a doubt I myself belong to that class of people of whom I was speaking to you in my letter, namely to that class of persons who don’t always think about what they’re saying and doing. I have a model almost every day, an old delivery man or some labourer or lad whom I have pose. Next Sunday I’ll perhaps have one or two soldiers who’ll come to pose. And so, since I’m no longer in a bad mood now, I have a quite different and better idea of you and of the whole world in general. was fortunate enough to know that I would find work there to earn at least 100 francs a month — be sure also, however, that since I’ve made a start with drawing, it isn’t in order to leave it at that; consequently I would mainly try to continue and to make progress in that direction. Drawing figures and scenes of everyday life requires not only knowledge of drawing as a craft, but in addition, rigorous study of literature, physiognomy &c., which are difficult to acquire.  That’s enough for today; I shake your hand; if you have a spare moment, write to me, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent 72 blvd du Midi Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b160 V/1962 (sheet 1), d294 V/1972 (sheet 2) and d295 V/1972 (sheet 3)2/4-81 72 blvd du Midi Bruxelles My dear Theo, Because the former will no doubt write to you about it himself, I address this question only because it concerns me personally, to some extent. Naturally this doesn’t have to happen all at once, though I’ve already made a start and shall continue. Such a person is therefore too circumspect and will have nothing to do with me at present, just when it’s most necessary for me to receive advice and help. And would I be to blame later on if I were to take revenge? Nonetheless, a draughtsman doesn’t draw for the sake of revenge but for the love of drawing, and that’s more compelling than any other reason. And so it’s likely that later on some things will be set to rights that aren’t quite right yet. And I don’t blame anyone for it, for relatively very few people know why a draughtsman does this or that. Peasants and townsfolk, however, generally impute very great wickedness and evil intentions never dreamt of by one who betakes himself to all manner of places, corners and holes that others prefer not to visit, in order to find picturesque places or figures.

Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b163 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘12/4-81My dear Theo, The beach at twilight, stormy weather, sky with grey clouds with a ruddy glow from the sun, which had set. I’m very glad indeed that it’s been arranged for me to work here quietly for a while, I hope to make as many studies as I possibly can, for that’s the seed from which later drawings will grow. Do write to me from time to time and keep me informed, if possible, of one thing and another that strikes you, and think of me if you happen to hear of a position for a draughtsman somewhere or other. And now it’s time for the post, I’ll keep you informed of what I’m doing, and you must also tell me from time to time what you would advise me, by preference, to draw and to look out for. Sometimes I’ll find it useful, sometimes perhaps not, but don’t hesitate to tell me one thing and another, I’ll do the same to you, and then we must both try to separate the wheat from the chaff. Adieu, with a handshake in thought. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b164 V/1962  My dear Theo, If it isn’t raining, I go outdoors every day, usually on the heath. The one with the woodcutters turned out the best, and I think it would please you. In thought a handshake, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b165 V/1962My dear Theo, It’s time that I wrote you a few lines again. What’s the situation about your coming here next summer? Is there still a chance that it’ll happen? I hope so. When I think about the circumstance of his being only 23 years old and other such things, it wouldn’t surprise me if the latter was the case. And now adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b166 V/1962My dear Theo, I haven’t had any for some time now and can’t get anything here but smooth paper without grain (unless one were to take thin Whatman or Harding, but that’s a bit too expensive for sketches, Ingres paper costs 10 centimes a sheet, I think). So do your best to stuff a smaller or larger quantity into your suitcase and you’ll oblige me more than with anything else. As I already said, write if you can, and accept a handshake in thought. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b167 V/19My dear Theo, I’m gradually putting my books back in order. I’ve read too much not to continue systematically to try to keep abreast of modern literature, to some extent at least. Sometimes I very much regret not knowing a great deal more about history, for example, especially modern history. Well, one won’t get any further by being sorry and having these sad thoughts; what one must try and do is simply struggle on. It gave me a great deal of pleasure to detect some truly good philosophy occasionally in your recent conversation. Who knows what a thoughtful creature you may become with time? Well, adieu, write if you can, and accept in thought a handshake, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b168 V/19My dear Theo, So I got some satisfaction there, also from that work. He wants me to start painting. Ever yours, Vt Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b169 V/1962     Maris made a number of watercolours of windmills in the snow. It is not known which work is referred to here – there is, in any case, one in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and another in the collection of the Kunstmuseum in The Hague. See exhib. cat. Amsterdam 2002, p. 130, and exhib. cat. The Hague 2005, p. 3My dear Theo, Even though I wrote to you only a short while ago, this time I have something more to say to you. Namely that a change has come about in my drawing, both in my manner of doing it and in the result. And it won’t stop there, of course, once a couple of sheep have crossed the bridge the whole flock follows. It’s quite certain that the drawings I’ve been making lately don’t much resemble anything I’ve made up till now. The size of the figures is more or less that of one of the Exercices au fusain. As regards landscape, I maintain that that should by no means have to suffer on account of it. On the contrary, it will gain by it. Herewith a couple of little sketches to give you an idea of them. Of course I have to pay the people who pose. Not very much, but because it’s an everyday occurrence it will be one more expense as long as I fail to sell any drawings. But because it’s only rarely that a figure is a total failure, it seems to me that the cost of models will be completely recouped fairly soon already. The other two sketches are poses of diggers. I hope to make several more of these. It would give me tremendous pleasure to have a woman pose with a seed basket in order to find that figure that I showed you last spring and which you see in the foreground of the first sketch. Remember that Ingres paper, if you will, of the colour of unbleached linen, the stronger kind if possible. In any case, write to me soon if you can, and accept a handshake in thought. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b170 a-b V/1962My dear Theo, I want to tell you what I’ve done since I last wrote to you. Still, there’s no particular hurry, because I have some on hand, but unfortunately plain white brought from The Hague. I wish you well, and accept a handshake in thought. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b171 V/19My dear Theo, It gave me a great deal of pleasure to receive your letter just now, and because I was intending to write to you anyway one of these days, I’m doing it now straightaway, in response to your letter. I think it’s wonderful that you’ve sent the Ingres paper, I still have some, but no more of that particular colour. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b172 V/1962My dear Theo, So now it’s settled that I’ll also set about painting, and I’m really glad it’s come to this. Well, recently I’ve done a great deal of drawing, especially figure studies. If you saw them now, you’d surely see what direction I’m taking. These days it’s beautiful outdoors in colour and tone, when I’ve gained some understanding of painting I’ll get around to expressing some of it, but we have to persevere, and now that I’m drawing figures I’ll go on with that until I’ve made a good deal more progress, and if I work outdoors it will be to do studies of trees, though actually viewing the trees as if they were figures. Now then, in my previous letter I forgot to tell you that I really think it very good that you’ll be going to London. I’d like it less if you were to move there for good, but it’s excellent that you’ll now become acquainted with it. But in the long run I don’t think you’d feel at home there, at least it’s becoming increasingly clear to me that, speaking for myself, I wasn’t really in my element there. I mean to do it, though, only after you’ve spoken to him and after I’ve started to paint. Because, Theo, my actual career begins with painting, don’t you think it’s all right to see it that way? And now regards, accept a handshake in thought, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b185 V/19Etten, 3/9 1881 My dear Theo, There’s something on my mind that I want to tell you. Perhaps you already know something about it, and what I’m telling you isn’t news. Then I was in an awful dilemma about what to do, to resign myself to that no, nay, never, or — not yet to regard the matter as over and done with, and to take courage and not give up yet. I chose the latter. And until now I haven’t regretted that decision, even though I’m still confronted with that no, nay, never. One of the reasons I haven’t written to you about it before now is that the position in which I found myself was so vague and undecided that I couldn’t explain it to you. Forgive the rather harsh terms I’m using to make my position clear to you. I admit that the colours are a little harsh and the lines drawn a bit too hard, but it will nevertheless give you a clearer picture of the situation than if I were to beat about the bush. So don’t suspect me of lack of respect for those Elder persons. Yet by now you understand that I mean to leave no stone unturned in my endeavours to bring me closer to her, and I declare that I shall love her so long Theo, aren’t you in love too, at times? I wish you were, for believe me, the ‘petty miseries’ of it are also of some value. Sometimes one is desolate, there are moments when one is in hell, as it were, but — it also brings with it other and better things. There are three stages, first not loving and not being loved, second loving and not being loved (the case in question), third loving and being loved. A handshake in thought, and write soon, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent If you should ever fall in love and receive a no, nay, never, by no means resign yourself to it! But you’re such a lucky dog that something like this will probably never happen to you, I hope. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b173 V/19Etten, 7/9 1881 Old boy, It wouldn’t surprise me, Theo, if my previous letter made a rather strange impression on you. But even so, I hope you’ll have received an impression from it that allows you to survey the terrain to some extent. I tried to indicate the proportions and planes with big, straight charcoal lines. Once the indispensable outlines have been found, we dust off the charcoal with a handkerchief or a wing and search more intimately for the contours. So this letter will be written in a more intimate, less harsh and sharp tone than the previous one. First of all, I must ask if you’re at all surprised that there is love serious and ardent enough not to be chilled, not even by a great many ‘no, nay, nevers’. I imagine that, far from causing surprise, you’ll surely find this very natural and reasonable. Love is indeed something positive, something strong, something so real that it’s just as impossible for someone who loves to take back that feeling as it is to take one’s own life. If you reply to this by saying ‘but there are in fact people who take their own life’, then I simply answer: I don’t really think that I’m a man with such inclinations. I’ve acquired a great appetite for life and I’m very glad that I love. My life and my love are one. But you’re confronted with a no, nay, never, you draw to my attention. Then I say to that, Old boy, for the time being I regard that ‘no, nay, never’ as a piece of ice that I press to my heart to thaw. So as for me, I’m pressing that piece of ‘no, nay, never’ ice to my heart, I don’t know what else to do, and if I want to try and hold out until it disappears and thaws — who’s to object??? Wouldn’t it be more humane of these people if they were willing and able to smile about it? I find it very sad indeed that there are so many who feel so strongly about it, but even so, I’m not planning to grow despondent about it nor to let go of the courage I’ve plucked up. God forbid. But I maintain that many buckets of cold water won’t cool me off for the present, old boy. I find it very unchristian, especially of Christians, to believe so firmly in that no, nay, never and to attach little or no power to the ‘love on’! And I swear that I don’t understand where they get it from, such vacillation, between irresoluteness and despondency in this case. And the physics that taught them about the unmeltability of ice is likewise a mystery to me. And it’s not easy for me to regard as friends those who want to upset me or distract me or thwart me or fob me off. O, whoever you may be who utters such abominations as I unwillingly repeat in the lines above, you say them in haste and clumsily and unthinkingly, don’t you? Surely you don’t want me to think that in your heart of hearts you’re really so conceited and shallow? God forbid that this should be the real you. If you weren’t friends, I would call you cowardly There are words, however, and you know them, One has to have loved, then fallen out of love, then love again! Love on! My darling, my dearest, my best beloved. I saw that she was always thinking about the past and buried herself in it with devotion. Then I thought: even though I respect this feeling and it touches and moves me, I still think there’s something fatal about that deep mourning of hers. So it shouldn’t be allowed to soften my heart, but I have to be as firm and sure as a blade of steel. I want to try and kindle ‘something new’ that doesn’t take away the old but instead gives it a right to exist. No, nay, never, what’s the opposite of that? Love on! So then, I feel calm and clear about it, and it’s precisely this that has an influence on my work, to which I’m drawn more and more every day, for the very reason that I realize I’ll succeed. Not that I’ll become something extraordinary but something very ‘ordinary’ indeed, and by ‘ordinary’ I mean that my work will be sound and reasonable and will have a reason to exist and will be able to serve some purpose. I think that nothing sets us down in reality as much as a true love. And he who is set down in reality, is he on the wrong path? I think not. But what should I compare it to, that strange feeling, that strange discovery of ‘loving’? For it’s truly the discovery of a new hemisphere in a person’s life when he falls seriously in love. Now you must definitely write to me, if you haven’t already done so, especially when you’ve received and read this letter. Because now, of course, I’m really longing for a letter from you, since speaking to you as I’ve done. I don’t believe you’ll think badly of me because of what I’ve said to you, but rather that you have more or less the same ideas about the matter of the general indispensability of a ‘she and no other’. At any rate, write to me soon now, and believe me (‘meanwhile’!!!) Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b174 a-b V/19Old boy, How cold and harsh my first letter must have sounded, and you undoubtedly thought then that I was already very callous and hardened. But was it wrong of me? And will you think badly of me for not immediately revealing my more tender and intimate feelings, since they would have found you, O man of business! in the fever of daily affairs, which is not exactly the mood to appreciate love stories. So I thought something along the lines of: no, first we’ll wake him up and only then will we sow softer words in His Hon. We’ll plough him first, this man who ‘deftly dispatches business’. That’s why the first letter was as cold as a ploughshare. But as to the second, was I wrong in claiming that it would be more serious and intimate? I say this from my own experience. But — that our home is and will continue to be our refuge, come what may, and we do well to appreciate this and are obliged for our part to honour that home — I agree with you entirely on that score, though you probably didn’t expect such a frank declaration from me. So then, O man of business, who dispatches business deftly, behold your greatest business affair, your own home with your own ‘she and no other’. Perhaps you remember that we talked this summer about the question of women, both with a kind of despondency. That we felt, or thought we felt, something like, And — and — I and possibly you too, at least a little bit, were in our view ‘the Mr Righteous in question’. Whether the above words are true or not I’m in no position to say, because since this summer I’ve begun to doubt if I actually knew then, first ‘what a woman is’, and second ‘what a righteous man is’. And I set out to examine both questions more closely, the result of such examination being that now I often say to myself,  You don’t yet know what a woman is, Which is completely different from my frame of mind this summer. Do you understand, my dear chap? In the same way and conversely must ‘a man breathe upon a woman if she is to be a woman’? I think so very certainly. If you ask me, How to breathe on her? Here’s my clear and simple answer, Behold, therefore, a love story for you, man of business! Do you think it very tedious and very sentimental? Indeed, he lost feathers galore, But what, my fine sirs, was in store? Now, however, it’s ‘a petty misery of human life’ for me that I can’t even occasionally visit her or write to her, and that those who, with me, might exert a wholesome influence on the undermining or bankrupting of that ‘no, nay, never’ instead rather too readily bring grist to the mill of ‘no, nay, never’. I would that she found no sympathy, anywhere or from anyone, for her ‘no, nay, never’, and that all would combine their efforts culpably to bankrupt that ‘no, nay, never’. In short, to reduce it once and for all to a monument, warning other no-nay-never-saying ladies and encouraging those who say ‘love on’. But we haven’t reached that point yet; but you, you Theo, don’t be for the ‘no, nay, never’ but instead for the ‘love on’! Naturally I can’t promise anything of the kind, and even if I were to cut off my correspondence with them for a while, I’d only take it up again afterwards with renewed vigour. But I would rather that they had a little more understanding of my thoughts and view of things. They think along the lines of a kind of resignation strategy regarding many things to which I cannot resign myself. She resolutely refused to say that word, however; instead, she cut short my opportunity. And came to me with a face full of pity and all kinds of consoling words, and without doubt she said a very nice prayer for me that would have granted me the strength to resign myself anyway. But until now that prayer has gone unanswered, and instead I’ve been given the strength to act. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b175 a-b V/1962 Succumbing to wounds the poor finch, Scratched and clawed to within an inch Of its life, then met its sad end. And the other? – it tore its attire And shed bundles of feathers entire.... As it flew again higher and higher, But it soon acquired feathers galore, Yes, my fine sirs, furthermore, Even lovelier than before. (Het vinkje bezweek onder wonden En klauwen, en werd verslonden, En ’t was met het vinkje gedaan. En de ander? – hij scheurde zijn kleêrtjes En liet er een bundeltje veêrtjes.... Maar vloog toch weêr op in de sfeertjes, En spoedig ook groeiden zijn veertjes Veel mooier, Meneertjes, Weêr aan.) See De Génestet 1869, vol. 1, pp. 259-26Dear brother, From the beginning of this love I’ve felt that unless I threw myself into it unreservedly, committing myself to it whole-heartedly, fully and forever, there would be absolutely no chance for me, and if I’ve thrown myself into it in the above-mentioned way, that doesn’t alter the fact that the chance is very small. But does it matter to me if the chance is larger or smaller? I mean, must I, can I, take that into account when I love? No — no thought to the winnings — one loves because one loves. To love — what a business! Just imagine what a real woman would think if she noticed that someone proposed to her, refusing to commit himself — wouldn’t she say something worse to him than ‘no, nay, never’? Oh Theo — let’s not talk about it, if you and I love then we love, that’s all there is to it. And then we keep a clear head and don’t cloud our minds nor restrain our feelings nor quench the fire and the light — but say simply, thank God — I love. Tell me now why they’re unsaleable; how could I make saleable ones? Because I’d like to earn some travelling money now and then to go and plumb the depths of the no, nay, never. Anyway — these days I really feel: ‘I have a draughtsman’s fist’, and I’m very glad to possess such an instrument, even though it’s still rather awkward. The Ingres paper is excellent. That’s what I’d like to know, you see. What kind of petty miseries do you have? Some I know partly or wholly, others not at all. Do you also have petty miseries involving a lady now and then? Naturally, but I’d like to hear what manner of miseries. Surely nothing like no, nay, nevers? Those petty miseries, or great ones, are riddles; looking for the solution — that’s certainly worth the effort. A lucky dog who complains — without reason! And they call me ‘the gloomy one’ and I ask you to congratulate me on a no, nay, never. This no, nay, never has, however, taught me things I didn’t know, first brought home to me the full measure of my ignorance, and second that there’s a woman’s world, and much, much more. But this in no way solves the riddle of no, nay, never. Trying the exact opposite of some advice often proves both practical and satisfying. That’s why in many cases it’s so useful to ask for advice. Even so, there’s advice that’s usable in its natural condition and doesn’t need to be turned inside out or upside down. This latter kind is, however, very rare and desirable, because it has special qualities. The former can be had ten for a penny. The latter is dear, the former costs nothing and is sometimes delivered, unasked-for, by the barrelful. ‘Meanwhile’!!! Yours truly, Vincent. Perhaps you haven’t really been a lucky dog until now, but I maintain that you’re well on the way to becoming one. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b176 a-b V/19Etten, 12 November 1881 My dear Theo, One phrase in your letter of 6 Nov. is worth a special reply. Especially when their inclination is neither positive nor negative, as is actually the case now, meaning not doing anything plainly for or against it. They take a step forwards, but, fearful of the consequences, they retreat; they take a step backwards, but then, too, something gnaws at them. There’s something fatal about that as well. They trust and they distrust. What to do? Be half-hearted! How pathetic you make a person! It’s a difficult position for me, for I can say nothing but Onward! But if I don’t see this – will my love be cooled by a couple of buckets of cold water? No, that won’t affect it one way or the other. I maintain that love, if it develops, fully develops, produces people of better character than the opposing passion Ambition & Co. But precisely because love is so strong, we are, especially in our youth (I mean now, 17, 18, 20 years old), usually not strong enough to maintain a straight course. The passions are the ship’s sails, you see. And someone of 20 who gives himself over completely to his feelings catches too much wind and his boat fills with water and – and he founders or..... he surfaces again. On the other hand, someone who hoists the sail of Ambition & Co. and none other, sails through life on a straight course without mishap, without rocking the boat until – until at last – at last circumstances arise in which he notices, I don’t have enough sail – then he says, I would give everything, everything I have, for one more square metre of sail and I don’t have it! He despairs. The first case, that of the man whose little boat capsized in his 20th year or thereabouts and perished, did it not? – or no – surfaced again recently – is actually that of your brother V. who writes to you as one: ‘who has been down but yet came up again’. The second case, that of the man who said ‘everything, everything I have for one more square metre of sail’ and he didn’t have it – and yet and yet... he has it! – that’s actually the position of my brother Theo perhaps. Absurd, wrong, exaggerated, haughty, arrogant. For in matters of love one mustn’t only take but also give, and conversely, not only give but also take. Two wholly – fatal – bad things. Both damned bad. Naturally there are those who praise one or other of these extremes to a greater or lesser extent, the first supplies us with those members of society one calls scoundrels, thieves &c., usurers &c., for instance, the second supplies us with Jesuits and Pharisees, male and female, scoundrels all of them! If you tell me to ‘take care not to become too fond of that no, nay, never’ and by that you mean, take care not to give everything and take nothing, then you’re perfectly right about that, and if you tell me that then I’ll say in return that I once made such a mistake. I gave up on a girl and she married someone else, and I went far away from her and kept her in my thoughts anyway. Fatal. Theo, to prove to you that I can reason calmly, even though I love, I’ll tell you the following. If she and I were of a sentimental nature and weak of heart, then we’d have taken each other already and reaped much misery from it later. Much poverty, hunger, cold, sickness, among other things, but oh we’d nonetheless have done better to take each other than not to take each other. If wild passion urged me on and she gave in to it, then that passion would cool and my morning-after would be desolation and hers a broken heart. If we were to play at being brother and sister we’d be acting like children, and that would be out of place. But if she and I stand up to a new life with renewed energy, then the future is not dark. If she with her lady’s hand and I with my draughtsman’s fist are willing to work, we won’t be short of our daily bread, nor will her boy. If I hadn’t been whole-hearted when proposing to her, she’d have despised me, and now she doesn’t despise me. If I didn’t believe that God can and does work miracles in this our daily life, her no, nay, never would already have made me desperate. But now that I believe in such miracles and expect such miracles and trust in and pray to the God that works them and don’t resign myself but act forcefully, God will have mercy on me and and – You must also hoist a ‘she and no other’ sail. And then our future will be better than our past. Look, you lucky dog, maybe I’m the only one who doesn’t find your past so very good and tells you so – and my criticism is ‘hasn’t loved enough’, have many others dared say that to you? Your remedy, like mine, ‘Love on! And no time to lose’. Even being a little in love is — and you’re right about this — as you say in your letter, having something good at bottom. I rather understand that in the circumstances. If you, brother, would care to send me some travelling money, I’ll make you a great many drawings of Het Heike and lots of other places. And they wouldn’t be any the worse if the no, nay, never began to thaw. Because the best means to go on drawing is to go on loving. Ever yours. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b177 a-c V/1962 Letter headed ‘Etten 12 November 1881Friday, 18/9-1881 Dear Brother, What I did, in fact, was ‘write letters’, behold the actual offence. Well, I’ll gladly believe that at times I couldn’t hide my indignation upon hearing ‘indelicate’ or ‘breaking ties’, but who would remain calm if it didn’t stop? But I already heard something similar last year, and thank God, far from being damned in reality, new life and new energy developed in me. So I have every confidence that it will be like that now as well, only more and stronger than last year. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b178 V/19Friday evening. Dear Brother, That’s really too bad, after all, and it would indeed be ridiculous to stop working for such a reason on a project that’s already started and progressing well. You’ll understand that a father shouldn’t curse his son because that son doesn’t obey the rules of decorum or expresses himself indelicately or other things, assuming this were all true, though I think it’s actually very different. But unfortunately it’s something that happens all too often in many families, that a father curses his son because of a love the parents disapprove of. Ever yours, Vincent A word from you ‘from Paris’! That would possibly carry some weight, even against prejudices. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b179 a-b V/19Dear brother, There’s a phrase in your letter that I’ll pick out and answer separately and immediately. I’ll copy your words. (Show me what I should believe in. Tell me if it’s enough to resign oneself when what one hoped would happen doesn’t happen, and instead of bringing about improvement withers one’s feelings.) Resign oneself! God forbid! Truly not. Can you resign yourself to a kind of damnation? Wouldn’t you say, as I do, I who am a much greater sinner than you, that ‘even though I might deserve damnation, I in no way resign myself to it but shall strive for something better, for freedom and deliverance and mercy!’ They looked each other in the eyes and took a few hesitant steps, more or less decided. Then Mister X said, very forcefully (?), ‘It’s not possible’, adding not unsentimentally, ‘who am I to hazard such a thing?’ And ‘she’, what do I know? – strong or weak, boisterous or serious, flippant or solemn, wretched in any case. Second phrase in the letter from T. v. G. that requires an urgent answer and not a moment to lose. ‘Precisely because I know what the consequences of an irrevocably lost hope can be, I don’t dare (guess) commit myself unhesitatingly’. Were I not ‘one who has been down’ but, on the contrary, one who had always stood firmly in his shoes, I’d be less than worthless to you, but because I’ve been in that mysterious, deep pit of heartache, there’s a slight chance that I can tell you something useful regarding some affair of the heart. Ever yours Vincent Even though you so mistakenly call yourself unbelieving, and perhaps think that you’re a materialist, even so you’re actually the first man who, if I dare to attack him forcefully, takes it well and comes back without anger. Although perhaps you now think that I’m rather strong in some ways, you’ll find me very ignorant and uneducated in a thousand other things. Alas, we become so one-sided in this fast-paced, hectic modern life. Listen once more, Theo, it’s an important matter. Should such as you and I doubt ourselves? No. Truly not any longer. We really wouldn’t want to discover at the end of our lives that we’d gone through the world like sleep-walkers. God forbid. Now it’s as clear as day to me that it’s both your duty and mine to make sure that we not only love but also marry. For this we must give proof of choosing sides and having principles and believing. You call yourself unbelieving. I beg your pardon? That you aren’t. Let your occupation be a modern one, and create in your wife a free, modern soul, free her of the terrible prejudices that restrain her. Do not doubt the help of God if you do what God wants you to do, and in this day and age God wants the world to be reformed by reforming morals, by renewing the light and the fire of eternal love. Why the hell should you and I be afraid of the key to the front door? Should you and I hesitate to propose to a girl, and should we doubt that in the end we’ll succeed? Certainly it’s presumptuous to feel sure of one’s success, and yet one may believe: my inner struggle will not be in vain, and I want to fight it; despite all my own weaknesses and faults I want to fight it as best I can. Now we’ll see how things develop. How beautiful the field is, old chap! When I earn more and can spend more on models, I’ll make entirely different things, you’ll see! Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b180 a-c V/19Etten, 23 Nov. 1881. Dear brother, All the same, the Bible is eternal and everlasting, but Michelet gives such extremely practical and clear suggestions, immediately applicable to this fast-paced, hectic modern life in which you and I find ourselves, that he makes us progress quickly, and we can’t do without him. Then we weren’t yet ready for the experience, now, at any rate, we’re much more ready than we were. Then we understood; now, though, we understand better and more. Fortunately, it’s calm, mild weather, which has a wholesome influence on people. If it were bitterly cold with a north wind, my ‘case in question’ would be much worse. Hoping to receive a few words from you before long, believe me, with a handshake Ever yours, Vincent You must understand that I’m doing my best to change many things about myself. Specifically the sad state of my financial affairs, and I also think it would do me no harm to spend more time with people. But staying here with the Brabant types needn’t prevent me from seeking to form relationships elsewhere, or even from living elsewhere for a while. All painters and draughtsmen do that, don’t they? Although I’ve always had one sorrow after another with the no, nay, never, I keep going back with more love each time. And I’ve already experienced many more good things than sorrows, although the sorrows really were sometimes serious, to say no more about them. The weather is so very calm and mild sometimes, won’t that have an influence? Will I be chucked out during or shortly after ‘the big celebration’? God forbid! Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b181 a-c V/1962 Letter headed: ‘Etten 23 Nov. 1881The Hague, Dec. 1881. My dear Theo, What to do now – because I must tell you that I didn’t return less in love than I went. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b182 V/19My dear Theo, It’s possible that you’ve been expecting a word from me to hear what I’m doing these days. And for my part I’ve been looking forward to a word from you. And I’m writing to you to tell you this. I haven’t any money to stay, I haven’t any money to go back. I’ll wait a day or so in any case and do whatever you want. Do you think it’s better that I stay here a while? I’d very much like to stay a bit longer, and not go back before I’ve progressed a great deal more. How marvellous watercolour is for expressing space and airiness, allowing the figure to be part of the atmosphere and life to enter it. So write to me in any case by return of post, and if you want me to stay, send me some money if possible. We’ll try and pull through and put some energy into it. Ever yours, Vincent. I have extremely bad ink here which has something red in it that has come through in the sketches. These are the subjects of 2 painted studies.

Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b184 a-c V/19The Hague, Thursday evening My dear Theo, I’m here now, and the fact is there’s no turning back. At an inconvenient time, but what’s to be done? I must have some simple furniture, and my expenses for drawing and painting materials aren’t getting any lower. I also have to try and dress better. It’s a daring move, and a question of sink or swim. But some day I’d have  set up house on my own, so what else can I do? Now things have gone faster than I expected. I’ll be moving into the studio around 1 January. Regarding furniture, I’ll take the very simplest, a wooden table, a couple of chairs. I ran around everywhere to find that studio, both in the city and in Scheveningen. Scheveningen is terribly expensive. This studio costs only 7 guilders a month, but the furniture makes it difficult. Still, if one has one’s own things, they won’t disappear, and one has surer ground beneath one’s feet. Adieu, old chap, accept a handshake in thought and write soon, believe me Ever yours, Vincent I still have a bit of money, but how long will I be able to get by on it? I have to stay at the boarding-house until 1 January. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b187 V/19Dear brother, I’m just writing to wish you a happy New Year, may it be a good year for you in every way and, I add egoistically, for myself as well. I hadn’t dared hope that things would go this quickly, but now I think it superb and hope that you do too. And now that I’m in my own studio, it will most probably make a not unfavourable impression on some people who until now have thought that I’m merely dabbling, idling or loafing about. The plan is that I continue to work regularly from a model. That’s expensive, and yet it’s the cheapest way. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b188 V/19Dear brother, But I haven’t received anything yet, not even a letter from you. The worst thing is that it’s impossible for me to work with a model before I have something in my pocket again, and so there’s almost nothing I can do, the weather is too bad to sit outdoors, although I’ve tried to repeatedly. I’m fine, but the last couple of days I’ve been weak from the tension. I’ve looked for models and know of a couple, but I can’t take them. But Tersteeg had just left town for a couple of days. I don’t want to talk to Iterson about it. If for one reason or another you can’t send the 100 francs all at once, send me part of it by return of post. I just found a stamp in my pocket, otherwise I wouldn’t even have been able to send this letter. It’s a time of struggle for you and for me, but I believe we’re progressing. So let’s keep our spirits up, adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b189 V/19You mustn’t think that I’m sending the letter back to insult you, but I find this the quickest way to answer it clearly. And if you didn’t have your letter back, you wouldn’t be able to understand what my answer refers to, whereas now the numbers guide you. I have no time, I’m waiting for a model today. Because I have only a little time, I knew no better means of answering your letter than to answer one thing and another like this, point by point. 8) Free-thinking: actually that’s a word I loathe, though I’m sometimes forced to use it for want of something better. 12) Write to me again. Yes of course, but first I have to agree with you on how.  Do you want me to write in a sort of business style, dry and formal and picking and choosing my words and actually saying nothing? Or do you want me to go on writing just as I’ve been doing recently, telling you everything that pops into my head without being afraid to let fly, without mincing my words or holding back. I prefer to do the latter, namely write or say plainly what I mean. Now I thank you very much indeed for what you sent. I don’t need to tell you that I really have a great many worries besides. Naturally my expenses are more than in Etten and I can’t set to work with half as much energy as I should like and should be able to if I had more at my disposal. And you know that I’m now struggling to make watercolours, and if I become adept at it they’ll become saleable. Now I’m going through a similar period of struggle and despondency, of patience and impatience, of hope and desolation. But I must plod on and anyway, after a while I’ll understand more about making watercolours. If it were that easy, one wouldn’t take any pleasure in it. And it’s exactly the same with painting. Moreover, the weather is bad, and this winter I haven’t yet gone out for pleasure. Still, I enjoy life and, in particular, having my own studio is too wonderful for words. When will you come and have coffee or tea with me? Soon I hope. You can stay here too, if necessary, that would be nice and companionable. And I even have flowers, and a couple of boxes of bulbs. And I’ve also acquired another ornament for my studio, I got a great bargain on some splendid woodcuts from The Graphic, some of them prints not of the clichés but of the blocks themselves. Just what I’ve been wanting for years. In short, it’s exactly the stuff I need. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b190 a-b V/19Dear brother, For one must make desperate attempts. Because there’s something diabolical about the execution of a watercolour. In addition to a couple of small watercolours, I’ve just started a large one, at least as large as one of those figure studies I made at Etten. Naturally it doesn’t automatically go well and easily straightaway. He’s supposed to be coming back tomorrow morning. Theo, I’m having a lot of trouble with the models, I search for them and when I find them it’s a struggle to get them to come to my studio, and sometimes they let me down. Like a smith’s boy this morning, who couldn’t come because his father said that I had to pay a guilder an hour, and of course I wasn’t inclined to do that. Well, adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b191 V/1962  My dear Theo, I’ve been working all this time with watercolour only, and it’s giving me more pleasure every day. How much I’d like you to be here, I’d have so much to tell and to ask you. Will you come again in the spring? Won’t you know a little in advance? Now, what I’ve made still isn’t good and is far from being so, but it’s again something different and it’s somewhat stronger and livelier in colour, and without body-colour. Now I hope that you’ll write to me again soon, and that we’ll definitely try to reach an agreement about the money. Well, for a while I carried on steadily nevertheless, but now I have no money. It’s natural that when one sets up house somewhere there are all kinds of expenses. But what I win by it is that I feel I’m progressing, and I’ll master the art of watercolour, and it needn’t even take very long before my work is saleable. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b192 a-b V/19(near the Rijnspoor) My dear Theo, Then, too, I have relatively few drawing materials, or otherwise inadequate ones. Well, I have my box and easel and brushes, enough in fact for the time being, but this week, for instance, my drawing board warped, becoming as curved as a barrel, because it was too thin, and my easel was also damaged during shipment here, which is bothersome enough. Well, adieu Theo, accept a handshake in thought, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b193 V/19Schenkweg 138 Thursday. My dear Theo, And I tell you frankly that I definitely think you mustn’t be embarrassed about going to a girl now and then, if you know one you can trust and you can feel something for, of which there are many in fact. Because for someone whose life is all hard work and exertion it’s necessary, absolutely necessary, to stay normal and to keep one’s wits about one. It would be good for you, it would be good for me, if we were married, but what can one do? Yet it will perhaps prove to you that it’s not a hopeless case, that I’m beginning to get the hang of it, rather. Still, I believe that the least expensive way is to persevere without losing any time. I believe he puts a little bit of his life into each painting and each drawing. Sometimes he’s dog-tired, and he said recently, ‘I’m not getting any stronger’, and anyone seeing him just then wouldn’t easily forget the expression on his face. The success or failure of a drawing also has a lot to do with one’s mood and condition, I believe. And that’s why I do what I can to stay clear-headed and cheerful. But sometimes, like now, some malaise or other takes hold of me, and then it doesn’t work at all. Anyway, I have some hope that as soon as I’m completely better things will go well, a little better than now. If I have to rest for a while I’ll do it, but it will probably be over soon. All things considered, though, I’m not like I was a year or so ago, when I never had to stay in bed for a day, and now there’s something thwarting me at every turn, even if it isn’t so bad. Accept a handshake in thought, I hope that I’ll soon have something better to tell you than I did today and recently, but you mustn’t hold it against me, I’m very weak. Adieu. Ever yours, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b194 V/1913 Feb. 82 My dear Theo, Even though I’m rather expecting a letter from you one of these days, I’ll write again anyway. I look forward every day to a letter from you, because I hope you’ll send me something one of these days. We must stick it out for a while, old chap, and persevere, you as well as I, and then we’ll both get pleasure from it sometime. I’m really very glad that I’ve gone on with the figure so far. If I’d been making only landscapes, perhaps I’d already be making something that would fetch a price, but later on I’d end up getting stuck anyway. Although the figure is more difficult and a more complicated matter, I believe it’s more solid in the long run. So at all events I’m expecting a letter from you any day now. I believe that I’ve got the proportions much better in my last drawings than in the previous ones, and that’s exactly what seemed to me to be the worst fault in my drawings up to now, but that’s changing, thank God, and then I won’t be afraid of anything. Adieu Theo, write soon, accept in thought a hearty handshake. Ever yours, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b195 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘13 Feb. 82My dear Theo, But he wants them small and only in watercolour and I can’t do that yet. One milestone has been passed, however. I work as hard as I can, but don’t forget that I’ll go under if I have too much worry and strain. So write by return of post if you can, send me something, and believe me, with a handshake, Ever yours, Vincent It means a great deal to me to feel that I’m beginning to draw better, and that keeps my spirits up. Drawing is the most important thing, no matter what they say, and far and away the most difficult as well. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b197 V/1962Saturday. My dear Theo, I’d have sent you news of its safe receipt immediately, but I’ve been very busy with a couple of drawings for which I had a model. For I’ll have you know that if you’re busy, so am I, and will be so more and more, because I’m getting more of an eye for my work, and so can tear myself away from it only with a great effort in order to write or to go and visit someone if necessary. When I think of Etten, a kind of shiver runs down my body as though I were in a church. In short, what can be done, and again, what can be done? Besides, you mustn’t blame me, Theo, or think that I’m carping, but you wrote something to me which you perhaps thought would make me happy, but it didn’t make me happy. It may take a longer or shorter time, but the way is really to penetrate deeply into nature. Today, now as I’m writing to you, I have a child that has to rest once in a while for half an hour, and I’m using that half-hour for this letter. Thanks again for what you sent, and a handshake in thought, adieu, Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b198 V/1962Friday, 3 March My dear Theo, But I must manage to sell something. If I could do so, I’d keep everything I’m now making of them for myself, because if I only kept them for a year I’m sure I could get more for them then than now. For the rest I’ll run after people less and less as time goes on, whoever they may be, neither art dealers nor painters, the only ones I’ll run after are models, because I find working without a model totally wrong, at least as far as I’m concerned. I say, Theo, it really is nice to see a tiny bit of light, and I do see a bit of light. It’s nice to draw a person, something that lives, it’s damned difficult but wonderful anyhow. Tomorrow two children are coming to visit whom I must amuse and draw at the same time. I want some life in my studio, and already have all kinds of acquaintances in the neighbourhood. On Sunday an orphan boy is coming, a perfect type, but unfortunately I can have him only for a short time. Sometimes it grieves me to think that I might have to let the model wait, because they need it so much. I’ve paid them up to today, but next week I wouldn’t be able to do it. But I can in fact have the model, be it the older woman or the younger or the child. Well, good evening, I hope to hear something from you soon. Ever yours, Vincent I also had to pay the rent this week. Good-night. It’s already two o’clock and I’m not finished yet. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b199 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘Vrijdag 3 MaartMy dear Theo, He would be right in reproaching me if I didn’t work, but it’s disgraceful to upbraid someone who works hard and constantly at difficult, painstaking work with such rebukes as ‘I’m absolutely certain that you’re no artist’, ‘for me it counts heavily against you that you started too late’, ‘you have to earn your bread’. Then I say, stop! Easy does it. One can’t always be friends, one must also quarrel occasionally. If you can, send me the money for this month soon. I’m progressing with my work, but I can’t work without money, or with too little. With a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent I’d like to know what the painters would say to his argument ‘take fewer models to economize’ at the very moment when, after much hunting, one has found models who aren’t too expensive. Working without a model is the bane of the figure painter, especially at the beginning of his career. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b200 V/19My dear Theo, But there’s also a bit of good news: I can rest assured that it’s due to his illness that he’s been so unfriendly to me recently, and not because my work was going in the wrong direction. You now have these particulars because I can’t understand why you’ve neither written nor sent anything this month. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b196 V/19My dear Theo. He condemns drawings of mine which contain much that is good, and I hadn’t expected that of His Hon. If I make serious studies from a model it’s a lot more practical than his practical talks about saleability or unsaleability, about which I – having dealt in paintings and drawings myself, for that matter – don’t need to be enlightened by His Hon. to the extent that he thinks. I’d prefer, then, to lose his friendship than agree with him about this. Although at times I’m overwhelmed by worries, all the same, I’m calm, and my calmness is based on my serious approach to my work and on reflection. Although I have moments of passion, and my disposition tends to make them worse, nonetheless I’m composed, as His Hon., who’s known me long enough, very well knows. Now he even said to me: you have too much patience. Perhaps – perhaps I’d succeed even now in making something in the genre of watercolour that could perhaps be sold with a great deal of effort. Believe me that in artistic matters the words hold true: Honesty is the best policy. Better to put a bit more effort into serious study than being stylish to win over the public. Occasionally, in times of worry, I’ve longed to be stylish, but on second thoughts I say no – just let me be myself – and express severe, rough, yet true things with rough workmanship. I won’t run after the art lovers or dealers, let those who are interested come to me. Adieu, I wish you health and good cheer, in spite of everything I’m not without good cheer either. I shake your hand. Vincent Theo, it’s almost miraculous!!! And something else moved me, and moved me deeply – I’d said that the model didn’t have to come today – I hadn’t said why – but the poor woman came anyway and I protested. Yes, but I’m not coming to be drawn, I’m just coming to make sure you’ve got something to eat – she had a portion of string beans and potatoes with her. There are indeed things in life that are worth the effort. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b201 a-b V/1962 The relationship between Sensier and Millet, on the one hand, and that between Vincent and Theo, on the other hand, have several things in common. Sensier provided Millet with financial support, for example (‘Always requests for money’, p. 196), sent him paint (p. 122), helped him to sell his work, and viewed him as an ‘elder brother’ (p. 147). Regarding this book, see Parsons and McWilliam 1984 and exhib. cat. Paris 199My dear Theo, No – he simply says – if they turn out well I’ll ask for another 12 of Amsterdam, provided you let me fix the price, then you’ll earn a bit more. Well, it seems to me that that’s not a bad way to end a visit I had rather dreaded. Because I actually made an agreement with you, Theo, simply to tell you things like this in my own way, as it flows from my pen, I’m describing these little scenes to you just as they happen. Especially because in this way, even though you’re absent, you get a glimpse of my studio anyway. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b202 a-b V/1962My dear Theo, Thinking it over later, I thought it might possibly have seemed strange to you to find in my last letter a remark about something I’d never discussed with you before, a remark, moreover, in a rather peremptory tone, namely something like: Theo, let it all go hang and become a painter. There’s a great landscapist in you. It may well be that these words slipped out at a time when my emotions were somewhat aroused. But that doesn’t mean that it isn’t the same with this as it is with other things that sometimes escape my lips in spite of myself, in anger or if some emotion or other is aroused. The fact is that what I say at such times are things I’ve kept bottled up for a long time, which I then say, sometimes in rough terms. But even though I’d express it better in a calmer mood, or keep it to myself, it’s absolutely certain that I’m most decidedly of that opinion, particularly in a calm mood. The impression he made on me then was a strong one – he was a practical man – extremely clever and lively, energetic in small and large things as well, he radiated poetry, as it were, but of the true, unsentimental kind. Then I had such respect for him that I always kept my distance, and I considered him a being of a higher order than myself. But I found that armour to be incredibly thick, so thick that I can’t say for certain whether the man is made of solid metal, be it steel or silver, or whether deep, deep down in that iron there’s still some small corner in which a human heart beats. If there’s no heart in him then my affection for him comes to an abrupt end, and instead there’s a ‘what are you doing to me? you irritate me’. So that in half a year or a year he’ll either leave me completely cold or – or  perhaps – I’ll find a way to get along better with His Hon. Meanwhile – he’s His Hon. to me. One doesn’t think in those terms of someone for whom one feels warm sympathy. His Hon. suggests something boring. Enough. Enough. Theo, I’m certainly no landscape painter, if I were to make landscapes there would always be something of the figure about them. I think it very good, though, that there are also people who are essentially landscapists. And it preoccupies me greatly that you might be just such a person – without knowing it. The opposite preoccupies me just as much. Namely, Theo, are you in fact essentially a dealer? And – it appears to me that there’s a possibility that there will come a time in one’s life when one regrets having bound oneself in that way. You mustn’t think that I’ve overlooked the change in financial circumstances that a change of career would mean for you. Yet what impels me to speak to you about this is that I feel, even beset by financial difficulties, that nothing is more solid than ‘handiwork’, in the literal sense of working with the hands. If you became a painter, one of the things that would amaze you is that painting and everything connected with it is really rather hard work from a physical point of view; quite apart from the mental exertion, turning things over in one’s mind, it requires a fair amount of effort, and that day after day. And that you won’t consider it a temptation of the devil. Well, we’ll see. It’s too late for philosophizing, though, considering I have to get up tomorrow at half past five, because the carpenter is coming to do a little job for me before he goes to work. So good-night and believe me, I mean it very seriously when I speak to you about your becoming a painter, adieu. Ever yours, Vincent And yet – it’s not really obvious – and perhaps there are few among his acquaintances who think of him as I do. Oh well. Still, he sometimes makes lovely things, not without charm and grace at any rate, but is that enough? So much is demanded that nowadays painting is almost an offensive, a military campaign, a battle or war. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b203 a-b V/19Friday morning Theo, I just wish, old chap, that you’d come here soon and see whether or not I’m deceiving you. I have to draw for about a year more, or at least several months yet, until my hand is steady and sure, and my eye, and then I see no reason at all why I shouldn’t become very productive commercially. That I ask for those few months’ time is reasonable. It can’t happen faster than that, or else I’d produce poor work and that’s not necessary, with a bit of waiting I’ll produce good work. Still, to make the most of your potential, you’d have to throw yourself into it with all your might. Theo, if you can send me something, do, and every day earlier that you can send it is one day less of unpleasantness for me. Oh well, it’s back to work in any case. Adieu, write soon. Ever yours, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b204 V/19My dear Theo, I’ve set about writing to you several times, but I couldn’t bring myself to finish the letter, because I wanted to write to you about various reasons why I thought it such a natural thing for you to become a painter. But I didn’t like what I’d written, and I couldn’t find any words that were strong enough. Nevertheless, so that you won’t suspect me of overlooking the financial side, I’d just like to say – yet with all due respect for your present position as an art dealer: unless one has a certain handicraft and can make something with his own hands, I doubt the soundness of the means of subsistence. I repeat: if you take up painting you’ll succeed and, by your 30th year, you as a painter will have worked your way up, no less so in any respect than at present. A mediocrity in the bad sense of the word will certainly not be the case with you if you take up painting. At first that grieved me – and then later it left me rather cold and I thought, I won’t let it upset me any more. Now, with a handshake Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b205 V/19April 82 My dear Theo, It shouldn’t surprise you that I wrote to you: become a painter. For I myself am now in a period in which I’m deriving some benefit from my earlier worries. Because as things are now, every week I make one thing or another that I couldn’t make before, and that’s what I spoke about, that it’s as though one were young again. And it’s the awareness that nothing – (except sickness) can rob me of the strength that’s now beginning to develop, it’s that awareness that gives me faith in the future and enables me to bear many unpleasantnesses in the present. It’s a wonderful thing to look at something and find it beautiful, to reflect on it and hold it fast and then to say: I’m going to draw that, and then to work on it until it’s done. Obviously that’s why I’m not yet content with my work to the extent that I think I needn’t do it any better. But the way to do it better later is to do it as well as one can today, there can’t be anything but progress tomorrow. And if I write to you, become a painter, then it really isn’t because I think that in your present position there isn’t a very great deal that’s beautiful. But I find being a painter more beautiful, and I wish you worked in your own studio instead of at a reading-desk in the office. There you have it. I know for certain that something would awaken in you in your own studio which you don’t know of now – a huge, hidden force of working and creating. What wonderful weather we’re having – there’s spring in everything. I can’t let go of the figure, for that’s No. 1 for me, but sometimes I can’t keep myself from going outdoors. But I’m busy with difficult things that I can’t let slide. Of course, doing it from life is something entirely different. Tersteeg is none the poorer by it, and in the beginning he himself said that I needn’t worry about it. Even though every 25 guilders less means that my work suffers and that I can’t do what really needs to be done. If I fill my portfolios with studies I’ll get my money’s worth out of them later. And I’d rather earn a bit more later than now. I’d rather see to it that I’m equal to my profession than rush to sell a drawing by the grace of God. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b206 V/1962 (sheet 1) and d329 V/1972 (sheet My dear Theo, The enclosed is, I think, the best figure I’ve drawn, that’s why I thought I’d send it to you. Ever yours, Vincent But the heart’s emptiness remains That nothing will make full again Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b207 V/1962 Once the heart is emptied, once the heart is emptied, it never becomes full again. (Ist das Herz geleert, ist das Herz geleert, wird’s nie mehr vollMy dear Theo, I received your last letter with the 150 francs enclosed in good order and thank you for it most sincerely. There is, to be sure, a connection between a person and his work, but it’s not easy to define the nature of that connection, and many are badly mistaken about it. Well, sleep well, it’s deep in the night, thanks again for what you sent, and believe me with a handshake, Ever yours, Vincent I hope to make you a pendant to ‘Sorrow’. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b208 V/1962My dear Theo, I may also have a few nice woodcuts, if you’d like them, since I have duplicates of several nice things. But you must look at them when you come this summer. With a handshake, Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b209 V/19My dear Theo, I sometimes think to myself: if only my life were a bit easier, how much more and better I’d be able to work than now. I do work and, as I think you’ve seen from my last drawings, I’m beginning to understand how to overcome the difficulties – but you see, almost no day goes by without something else cropping up besides the effort of drawing, which would be difficult enough even if one had nothing else to endure. And, you see, there’s sorrow which I believe is really not my due – at least I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve it – and which I’d very much like to dispel. Be so good as to tell me frankly whether you know anything about the cause of the following and can enlighten me. I attributed it to dissatisfaction with my work, and was so anxious and agitated about it that I became extremely upset and fell ill, as I wrote to you at the time. But one evening shortly afterwards he started talking to me again in such a totally different way that it seemed to me that I was confronted with a completely different man. I thought, my dear friend, it’s just as if someone has poured poison in your ear – slander, in fact – but I was in the dark as to where the venomous wind was coming from. Do you perhaps know something about this that I don’t? Could you perhaps enlighten me on this subject? Adieu. Ever yours, Vincent Forgive me for bothering you with this, but you see, I’m so much in the dark. In a case of differing views on artistic matters it is, in my opinion, not fair to rob someone of his means of subsistence or attempt to turn his friends against him for reasons relating to his private life. I once wanted to reprimand someone who often received bread from me. No, I thought, I’ll endure it from him, because otherwise he’ll have nothing to eat. You understand, but people with certain manners see things like that differently. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b210 V/19Theo, It’s precisely because I have a draughtsman’s fist that I can’t keep myself from drawing and, I ask you, have I ever doubted or hesitated or wavered since the day I began to draw? I think you know very well that I’ve hacked my way through and am obviously ever more keen to do battle. Now I’m struggling along as I see fit, and it seems to me I’m not one of those who complain that ‘there are no models in The Hague’. So if remarks are made about my manners in the sense of clothing, face, manner of speaking, what shall I say in reply  – – –  that such talk bores me. Do I lower myself by living with the people I draw, do I lower myself by frequenting the houses of workers and poor people or by receiving them in my studio? It seems to me that my profession involves that, and only those who understand nothing of painting or drawing are entitled to find fault with it. I ask this: where do the draughtsmen for The Graphic, Punch &c. get their models? Do they or don’t they go themselves to round them up in the poorest alleyways of London? And the knowledge they have of the people, is it innate – or did they acquire it later in life by living among the people and by paying attention to things that most people walk right past, by remembering what many forget? Adieu Theo – do your best in this affair – if I have a bit of good fortune here instead of misfortune, I won’t have to make life difficult for you, and now enough, believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b211 a-b V/1962 (sheets 1, 2) and d322 V/1972 (sheet My dear Theo, It’s inconsiderate, insensitive, those aren’t manners, it’s not humane. And who am I – someone with difficult, painstaking work that demands peace and quiet and some sympathy, otherwise my work is impossible. I have more to tell you about my plans for the future, how I intend to continue my work. You must come here first, though, so I’m not writing about that now, seeing as you won’t, I hope, be staying away very much longer. The most necessary things are bread, clothing, rent, models, drawing materials. And it’s not such a tremendous amount, the way I go about it – and I can make drawings in return, provided someone wants them. I don’t desire wealth, but of course I can’t stand the thought of not having the most necessary things. A workman is worth his wages.  If he stands by them, I’ll consider him an enemy who can’t stand the sight of me, rather than a friend. Adieu, Theo, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b212 V/19My dear Theo, I like graphite better in its natural form than cut too fine in those expensive Fabers. And the shininess disappears by fixing it with milk. If one sits outdoors and works with Conté, one can’t really tell what one’s doing because of the bright light and notices that it’s become too black, but graphite is more grey than black, and one can always obtain a couple of extra octaves by working it over with the pen, so that the strongest intensities of graphite actually lighten up through the repoussoir of the pen. I’d like it very much, and the owner would like to have me rent it; he spoke to me about it first and then I went to see it. Ever yours, Vincent If you’re coming soon, I won’t send the drawings. But it’s time you started to get things from me, I’ll do my best, and if you like these two, for example, you’ll get many more and of all kinds. If you show the ones you find suitable to the people who come to your room, perhaps that would be the beginning of selling them, and particularly when a number of them are shown together, and various ones by the same hand, they draw attention to one another, and the one complements and explains the other. What I value most is your sympathy. If I positively win that, the selling will follow. But neither I nor you must force that sympathy. Adieu, enough for today. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b217 a-b V/1962Vincent Tuesday evening Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b218 V/1962 Postmarked: Tuesday, 2 May 1882; this concurs with the comment below the signature: ‘Tuesday eveningMy dear Theo, In the end he said, ‘you have a vicious character’. At that point I turned around – it was in the dunes – and walked home alone. A pregnant woman who roamed the streets in winter – who had to earn her bread, you can imagine how. Vincent My drawings are ‘by my model and me’. But I thought it might be good for you to know how I spend my time. These studies demand a rather dry technique, if I’d concentrated here on the effect they’d be less useful to me later on. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b213 a-b V/19My dear Theo. Anyway, this one understood, and she said to me, I know you don’t have much money, but if you had even less, I’d do anything if only you’d stay with me and let me stay with you, I’m too attached to you to be capable of being alone again. When someone says this to me and shows in everything that she means it, much more through actions than words, it’s no wonder that in front of her I dropped the mask of coolness, and roughness almost, which I’ve long worn because I didn’t want to cajole. Now then, is this woman worse off or am I worse off because it turned out this way? I’m amazed at the sight of her getting stronger and more cheerful every day, she’s so changed that she seems like a completely different person from the sick, pale woman I met this winter. And yet, I haven’t done much for her, I only said to her: do this, do that and you’ll get better – and she didn’t disregard it, and when I noticed that she didn’t disregard it, I tried even harder to do my best. First of all, her speech, which is ugly and which is the result of her illness, then her temper, which stems from a nervous disposition, causing her to have moods that many would find unbearable. I understand these things, they don’t bother me, and until now I’ve been able to deal with them. And for her part, she understands my own temper, and we have a tacit agreement, as it were, not to carp at each other. She’s learning to pose better every day, and that’s extremely important to me. She isn’t a burden, a millstone round my neck; instead, she helps and works with me. She has no pretensions, I’ve got to have things just this way or that, and if there’s nothing but bread and coffee she makes do with that without complaining. The first step I’d like to take is to rent the studio next door, which I wrote to you about. As soon as she returns from Leiden I’ll marry her without telling anyone about it, quietly and without any fuss. And then we’ll be able to manage with that house and are prepared to live as simply as possible. And if you were able to come and have a look, I believe you’d see that you can rely on both of us doing our best as regards work. I only wish her confinement were already over. That will be an ordeal for her. But until now everything has been all right, since she’s been to Leiden. Still, neither she nor I are living on a bed of roses or dreaming in the moonlight, we’re facing hard things – so much the better. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b216 V/19My dear Theo, This is why, because I see so many weak people downtrodden, I seriously doubt the genuineness of much of what one calls progress and civilization. Anyway, enough. If I could rent the house next door, if I could have a weekly allowance, it would be wonderful. If not, I won’t give up hope and shall wait a while longer. But if the first is possible, it would be so fortunate for me, and would give me more strength for my work that is otherwise absorbed by cares. You’ll see that the portfolio contains all kinds of things. Keep what appears to be the best of what I send, which you can then show if the occasion arises. The rest I’ll get back at your convenience. But now that I’ve told you what I said in this letter and the previous ones, it will seem less incomprehensible to you. I wish that those who wish me well understood that what I’m doing is prompted by a deep feeling of and need for love, that frivolity and arrogance and indifference are not the springs that drive the machine, and that if I take this step it’s proof that I’m taking root close to the ground. I don’t think I’d do well to strive for a higher station or to change much in my character. I must experience even more, must learn a lot more before I’ll be mature, but that’s a question of time and continuing to work. Adieu, write soon, if there’s anything to spare it certainly wouldn’t be ill-timed. Believe me, with a handshake, Ever yours, Vincent Naturally I hope that in no way will your help and sympathy come to an end, and that we’ll continue to hold out a brotherly hand to each other despite things ‘the world’ opposes. So, old chap, if you receive this and haven’t written yet, let me hear something by return of post, because after what I told you I need to be reassured or else to know the worst. Adieu. I hope that the air stays clear between you and me. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b219 a-b V/19My dear Theo, For my part I feel sympathy or antipathy for people as people, and care little about what they have around them. ‘There are many who keep up a certain position to ensure that they won’t be constantly watched and that people won’t meddle in their affairs too much.’ I mean, very often I too let things pass, thinking I shan’t do or say this or that so as not to offend someone.  But in important, serious matters one shouldn’t let one’s actions be guided by public opinion or by one’s own passions. The behaviour of that person was guilty before God, yet in the eyes of the world he kept his position — ‘he had paid her’. But when he faced DEATH, would there have been no regret or remorse in him then??? If I were married to a woman and I saw that she was also carrying on with another, I wouldn’t let myself be made a fool of, but I wouldn’t leave her until I had tried my utmost to reclaim her. So you see how I think about marriage, and that I take it seriously.  I began it  though not immediately with marriage in mind – but when I got to know her better, it became clear to me that if I wanted to help her I would have to take a more serious approach. I then spoke candidly with her and said: this is what I think about one thing and another, this is how I see your position and mine. I’m poor – but I’m no seducer. Do you think you could get on with me or not? – otherwise that’s the end of it. Then she said, I want to stay with you, however poor you are. This is how we ended up where we are now. And now she’s soon going to Leiden, and immediately afterwards I would like to marry her without further ado. Because otherwise there will be something false in her position and in mine, which I would most decidedly prefer to avoid.  Now, I do believe, Theo, that I’ve brought no shame on my family by what I’ve done – and I wish that my family were reconciled to it. Otherwise, we confront each other, and I say for my part: not for anyone’s sake will I abandon a woman to whom I am tied by a bond woven by mutual help and respect. Then, however, as you know, though I followed her to the end, though I went after her all the way to Amsterdam, I was unable to speak to her or to get any firm undertaking, anything I could rely on. Thus in the main I think your letter is very wrong, but this may be because you haven’t thought it through, and I believe you’re better than that letter of yours this morning.  Yet - heavens above – what’s going on – and what kind of age are we living in? – do wake up, Theo! – don’t let yourself be overwhelmed or influenced by Jesuitisms. Do I deserve to be left in the lurch because I helped a pregnant woman and don’t want to send her back onto the streets? We’ve promised to be loyal to each other; is that not allowed? Is death the punishment for that???  Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b220 a-b V/19My dear Theo, These days, money is what might is right was in the past. Contradicting someone is fatal, and if you do it their reaction is not to reflect but to give you a punch in the throat. That’s to say, in the shape of ‘I shan’t buy anything by him any more’ or ‘I won’t help him again’.  Yet I had no rest. The tension became unbearable because she stayed silent all the time, because I never received so much as a syllable in reply.  They have too much support, they know all too well that most people want to have things that way, and they keep in with everybody.  Then I reason with myself: I shan’t take it to heart, but I’m nervous and a thing like that stays with me and comes back when I start work again. So that I have to change tack and work on other things. Now, these last months I’ve had more expenses, but I’ve had to settle in, and I ask you: are these expenses unreasonable or excessive? Especially since you know what else was involved. And how often in those long years I had much less than 100 francs. And if I sometimes had expenses because of travelling, have I not improved my knowledge of languages and developed my mind? Was that money down the drain? And yet, after your letter I wanted to write to you. In Amsterdam I was so flatly refused, so fobbed off that it would have been lunacy to persist. But should I have despaired at that point? Jumped into the water or something like that? God forbid. I would have done that if I had been a bad person. I renewed myself, not on purpose but because I found an opportunity for renewal and didn’t refuse to begin again. Ever yours, Vincent You’ll say, but that help hasn’t stopped... but I received it with a certain reserve, thinking he doesn’t yet know everything he will know one day, and until the crisis comes I’ll have no rest and remain on guard, prepared for the worst. Do you understand any of this?...  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b214 a-d V/19My dear Theo, Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b221 V/19My dear Theo, I long for your letter and hope you’ll soon find time to write. It seems to me that you can do a great deal of good in this affair in that, knowing how matters stand (and if you need further information about that, I’ll be happy to provide it as honestly as I can), in that, as I say, knowing what the position is, you’ll be able to moderate and modify somewhat the judgement of those who will later hear about the matter but still not understand exactly what it’s all about, so that it doesn’t lead to unpleasantness.  But — I did wish I knew what to do about the studio I wrote to you about. I would also be content with a poorer house, but I don’t know of a more suitable and practical one. And fear that a less practical one wouldn’t really be cheaper, because then my work would suffer, even if I saved a few guilders a month by paying less rent.  And later would probably say, why did I let that studio go and not take more trouble to get it?  More than for a letter, I long for your visit, but I understand that it may have to wait for some time. I’m not really in the mood for writing, but sometimes I have to. If you could send me a little more, it would be good, for things aren’t easy for me. Well, in any case write soon. I would especially like to know what you think about the studio — it could be gone any day. Adieu. Again, don’t inconvenience yourself, but if you can, send me a little more. Ever yours, Vincent And also write to say whether you’ve received the drawings. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b222 V/19My dear Theo, I must tell you that these days I’m already out of doors by 4 o’clock in the morning, because during the day it’s too difficult to be on the street on account of the passers-by and the urchins, and because that’s the best time to see the broad outlines while things still have tone. The rent is due on 1 June, and I have nothing, literally nothing. I hope you’ll send something.  That same drawing may be sold later for 50 guilders or so, and now — I hadn’t got the money to have a tear in it repaired.  Anyway. She’s so willing to help in everything that I can’t tell you how useful she is to me. If I get angry while she’s posing or about something else, she knows how to take it, and has seen that it doesn’t go deep with me. Equally, if I fret or grumble about something that isn’t going well, she often manages to calm me down, which I couldn’t do myself.  And she’s thrifty and accepts our piece of black bread if need be, without becoming despondent. And so do I, as long as we get by. And at that price, he can’t go wrong.  I’m hoping for your letter. Accept a handshake in thought, but above all write soon and save me from the landlord. Adieu. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b224 V/19My dear brother, Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b225 V/19My dear Theo, But, you will say, a clever lawyer will twist the law &c. &c. So be it, but I say to you, in this day and age people aren’t made wards of court so easily or so readily... In the event of illness I hope that you would resist any attempt to exploit my helplessness. In a healthy state I can deal with it on my own, and have no fear of anything of this kind. And I can’t believe that they’d really resort to such a measure, but if at some time you learn that steps are being taken, let me know.  Now you will say: Vincent, immerse yourself instead in perspective and the Fish-drying barns. And then I say, you’re quite right, brother, and that’s why I’m going to work on the two drawings that belong with the first, and that you’ll presently receive as proof that I like nothing so much as immersing myself in the things of nature and drawing, without going into such, to me, eminently foolish matters as being made a ward of court. Adieu, with my warm thanks for your loyal help. Ever yours, Vincent. Vincent \n",
      " My dear Theo, I don’t know whether you have the Constitution of the Netherlands and the other laws. I’ve frequently consulted them about various questions for myself, if I doubted the legality of something or other. And not only the Dutch laws, but I’ve sometimes taken the trouble to compare the Dutch regulations with the French or English constitution. Not only now but in previous years when I was studying some points of history, I had to look up the laws.  But one thing is certain: one may not proceed behind someone’s back, not even, I believe, make decisions about someone, even in a family council, unless the accused, or rather the person about whom the council is deliberating, is present. But what is a family council? In many cases no more than an intrigue, sometimes a sop to the family’s vanity — much ado about nothing.  But often something is decided which proves that those present have overlooked the law and which will thus not be upheld when it actually comes to court. If I really were a bad or spiteful, trouble-making person or an intriguer or dimwit, then I really would be afraid.  Now, being as I am, I really don’t believe that I have anything to fear from any steps the family or members of the family may take against me. It is my sincere wish that no steps be taken against me, not because I fear anything but because I would rather have peace than disputes.  Let me be quite clear, the lives of the woman, the children and me hang by the thread of the 150 francs a month until my work starts to go. There you have it, brother. May the ‘dramatic’ be avoided and may serenity prevail for all of us. This is my hope and this is what I strive for.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b226 a-b V/1962 (sheet 1, 2) and b223 a-b V/1962 (sheet 3, 4My dear Theo, Today, Saturday, I’m sending you the two drawings Weissenbruch, for example, wouldn’t find these two drawings disagreeable or dull. I didn’t manage to make the thing the first time around, but I succeeded in the end after trying for a long time with the aid of the carpenter and the smith. And I think that with more work I can get much better results still. It would please me greatly if perhaps in your wardrobe there was a jacket and trousers suitable for me which you no longer wear.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b227 V/1962Municipal hospital (4th class, Ward 6, no. 9) My dear Theo, I’d prefer to get back to work in a fortnight, of course, and I’ll be dying to go back to the dunes in a fortnight.  Anyway, a letter from you would of course give me great pleasure at the moment. Adieu with a handshake, and wishing you as much good fortune as anyone could deal with. Ever yours, Vincent But write soon, for I’m longing for a letter. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b228 V/1962 The letter was written after Van Gogh was admitted to hospital on 7 June 1882, but there is no concrete evidence for a precise date. Assuming that Van Gogh wanted to inform his brother about his situation fairly quickly, we date the letter to on or about Thursday, 8 June 188My dear Theo, Few things have given me so much pleasure recently as hearing reports from home just now that greatly reassure me as to their mood. I can’t tell you how it affected me, especially now — it’s better than I expected — but they still don’t know about one thing and another. Yet I’m greatly reassured.  But I’m not allowed to draw it, and couldn’t anyway as long as I’m so weak. But despite not being allowed to get out of bed, in the evening I can’t resist going over to look at it.  Write to me soon. It was so kind of home and gave me so much pleasure, especially now. The rest is doing me so much good and making me much calmer and taking away the nervousness I’ve suffered from so much recently. And here in the ward it’s no less fascinating for me than the 3rd-class waiting room. But I may not and cannot draw just yet.  Adieu, I hope you’ll write to me. Believe me Ever yours, Vincent You know the address is Hospital Brouwersgracht 4th Class Ward 6, No. 9. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b229 V/19The Hague, 22 June My dear Theo, But it might perhaps be good for a great many people if they underwent this from time to time, because it’s a preventive measure for troublesome conditions that develop very, very slowly. But I assure you that I long dreadfully for a little greenery and some fresh air, for a thing like this makes you very weak and faint. I can’t draw because I must lie still almost continuously, although I have tried a few times; it makes me too feverish. I can read but I’ve run out of books. Anyway, it will come to an end, so I must be patient.  I believe that here in this class the doctor gives shorter shrift than in the more expensive ones. So much the better. I hope you’ll write again. You know the address is: Adieu, a handshake in thought, and many thanks again for your loyal letter and the enclosure. I wish you well, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b230 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘den Haag 22 Junij’. We assume that Van Gogh wrote this himself, despite the different handwriting in this line. This is probably due to the fact that it is a later addition for which there was little space. It is unlikely that Jo van Gogh-Bonger put the date on: she never used the spelling ‘Junij’.   On Saturday evening we received a letter from him written in the hospital in which he said that he was ill and had gone there. He had just received a package from us with a 10-guilder coin as well. He wrote in a mild tone and said that he was reassured by our letter, etc. etc. Vincent had concluded from this that Tersteeg and Mauve had urged you to not to send your contribution any more, and that idea seems to have made him agitated again. Tersteeg knew these details from you or from your letters.  I told Vincent that when he was allowed to leave the hospital he could come to us to get his strength back but, while he appreciated the offer, he thought it better not to avail himself of it, because he wanted to get back to work. Yesterday morning at 10 o’clock I returned from Leiden and went to see him again. And I asked the doctor to let me know if, Heaven forbid, there was a change for the worse. Before that, however, I drove to his house, where the people said they didn’t really know where the gentleman was. He had said he was leaving the city for 14 days, but they believed he was in the hospital. They couldn’t show me his studio because they hadn’t got the key.  Don’t say that I think the worst. I say this to no one else but you and you will understand – how I mean it, truly not to burden him, but in part out of fear. There is in him an inclination towards the lower classes, and sometimes a person can enter into an improper connection out of perversity or a sense of desolation. You understand, though we are not now afraid of this illness turning out badly, we continue to be concerned about him and that concern has not diminished. He also talked about wanting to take another house – in the same neighbourhood – where he would have better opportunities ... What a support you are for Vincent. Bye, old chap!’ (FRb22401 July 1882 My dear Theo, Well, adieu, write soon, and believe me, with a handshake Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b231 a-b V/1962 Letter headed: ‘1 Juli 1882Sunday afternoon My dear Theo, And he says that she had been at death’s door more than once, especially during her previous throat illness, in an earlier miscarriage, and then last winter, that she has been profoundly weakened by a life of turmoil and agitation, year after year, that now that she no longer needed to lead that life she’d recover of her own accord, provided there are no complications, with rest, tonics, plenty of fresh air and no heavy labour. I long to see you. Well brother, you have it on your conscience that I’m so happy today that it made me cry. Thanks for everything, old chap, and believe me, with a handshake in thought, Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b232 V/19Tuesday afternoon My dear Theo, Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b233 V/19Dear brother, The emptiness, the inexpressible wretchedness inside, made me think — yes, I can understand why there are people who jump into the water — it’s just that I was far from approving of what those people did, and I found solidity in the words I’ve quoted, and thought it much the better approach to get hold of oneself and seek a medicine in work. The way, as you know, I tackled it then.  There’s a difference between your case and mine in several respects. Your failure was when you were twenty, mine last year. But although both you and I may have had an illusion, failure or whatever — I really don’t know what to call it — that doesn’t rule out something more real, either for you or for me. For I’m quite sure that neither of us is cut out to be celibate.  This winter we had the woman’s pregnancy and my expenses in getting settled. Now the woman has given birth, I’ve been ill for four weeks — and still not better — despite all that the place is clean and cheerful and bright and tidy, and I have a large part of my furniture, bedding and painting materials.  It has cost what it cost, to be sure I won’t underestimate it, but your money hasn’t gone down the drain. A young studio has come from it which can’t yet do without your help, but from which more and more drawings will gradually emerge and which requires only essential furniture and tools, which retain their value.  But I don’t stay out of it because I’m afraid of them or am at a loss for words. Also, I’ve often noticed that they say nothing in my presence, and even claim never to have said anything. As for you, knowing that I don’t get involved in order not to make myself nervous and because of my work, you’ll be able to understand my attitude and not think it cowardly of me, won’t you?  But neither you nor anyone else who takes the trouble to think about it will, I hope, condemn me or find me unbearable because of that. I fight against it, but that doesn’t alter my temperament. And even if I consequently have a bad side, well damn it, I have my good side as well, and can’t they take that into consideration too? Ever yours, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b234 a-c V/19Thursday My dear Theo, But you mustn’t imagine that I bought all of this at once. In the winter we’d already begun buying one thing and another, bit by bit, even though I didn’t know at the time what course it would take or where we’d end up. And now, thank God, the outcome is that the little nest is ready for her after all her pain.  Ever yours, Vincent Friday evening. My dear Theo, I’m adding a word today to my enclosed letter of yesterday evening. And can tell you that I’ve been to the doctor at the hospital and he said that since I had been feeling quite well recently I needn’t come back unless it got worse.  While not completely normal and not entirely free of pain, the fact that I was able to pass water regularly on those days is proof that things are on the mend.  I still get tired and weary remarkably quickly, which comes from having had to stay quiet and lie in bed for so long, and that’s a strange feeling. But in many respects I feel well and healthier than last winter. And I feel in such good spirits and thankful for many things.  Adieu Theo, sleep well, how wonderful it is to be back in one’s normal routine. I wish you well and good fortune, and what I wish you above all in large measure is that serenity. With a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b235 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b236 V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, I would have given a lot to have you see her today. Her appearance has changed enormously, I assure you, since this winter. It’s a complete transformation.  In May there was a combination of difficulties, her confinement, my illness, and this was complicated by the question of what to do, where she was to go. In many respects, light and a resolution have come.  I hope you won’t feel any scruples about meeting her.  On days when she feels more thirst than hunger, as often happens, she is to take a glass of bitters as a medicine to stimulate the appetite.  He has given her the list of restoratives, having consulted her as to her means. I’ll also keep to what he recommends in this respect. Meat is good for her, but once or twice a week is actually enough; it certainly isn’t required every day.  Even if I have to give up working out of doors for a considerable time if my health deteriorates (which I hope won’t happen), at any rate now I’ll have enough material indoors to occupy myself.  I’m glad to have seen all this. Adieu, with a hearty handshake in thought. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b237 a-b V/1962Tuesday morning. My dear Theo, Wasn’t it as ridiculous as if I were to drive about the city in my own carriage? To which I replied that it was most definitely a different matter entirely. Was I not right in the head? It was obviously the product of a sick mind and body.  And finally, because I clearly showed that I wanted to end the conversation, he left. I’m writing to you immediately. I told him that I wrote to you about it, no more than that. This also calmed him somewhat.  Things are all right with home at the moment, but, you’ll see, who knows whether he won’t ruin it all again.  That’s what he’s after, and they wouldn’t shrink from using force.  It depends on whether we have the monthly sum from you to allow us to stay together.  If you agree, we’ll take no further notice of it, however, and not let ourselves be upset. But write to us soon, for I’m in great need of a letter from you. I don’t want my head to be full of worry and care, since my getting better depends on keeping calm.  As long as I can drown with her, I don’t much care. But we felt sufficiently that her life and my life were one when we saw each other again beside the baby’s cradle in the hospital.  Hallo, brother! But I mustn’t lapse into things like that. It’s healthier to continue thinking calmly about working and getting better, and living quietly day by day.  There may be no tampering with this, Theo, for it’s the holiest thing there is in life.  I say with God’s help, because I’m grateful to God as well as to you for the help I’ve received and still receive from you.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b238 a-c V/19My dear Theo, Once we’d got that far, I thought, we could talk about marriage again. But you will remember that in my later letters I didn’t speak of that so directly any more.  For the family the most important question is probably civil marriage. That’s important to her and me, but all the same secondary to the essence of the matter, the love and loyalty between her and me as it already exists and daily grows.  I want to propose that we let the whole subject of civil marriage rest for a while and, for example, postpone speaking about it until such time as I earn around 150 francs a month by selling my work, so that help from you is no longer required. Thus with YOU, but with you alone, I want to agree that for the time being I won’t marry her — in a civil marriage — until the drawing business is going so well that I’m independent. As soon as I begin to earn, you will gradually send less, and eventually, when you can stop sending money altogether, we’ll return to the question of civil marriage.  But now, as to the meantime — it would be quite absurd after this entire winter, and above all after everything that has happened in recent months, to want to detach or part me from her. We are chained and tied to each other by a strong bond of sincere affection.  And through the help we give each other. For, if I may put it this way, she’s my associate in the work and more, infinitely more than an ordinary model, because she’s so willing and intelligent in posing that I can’t praise her too much. Especially now that the better light and the better studio automatically put the idea in my mind.  I just hope, Theo, that what I’ve said about marriage will make you see that I don’t demand to have my own way in everything, that I’ll go along with what you think as far as I can, but see this also as proof that I deserve to have your trust and to have you write to me about various things. I can’t get on with the others, and with you I can talk and reach a compromise.  And that — no matter who thinks it wrong — you will understand and not try to stop me. I accordingly give you the credit for her recovery, in that I attribute only a small part to myself. I was merely the means.  Rest assured of her and my warmest affection, and accept in thought a handshake, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b239 a-b V/19Dear Brother, It’s already late, but I wanted to write to you again. You aren’t here, yet I’m in need of you, and it seems to me as if we aren’t far apart sometimes.  Today I made an agreement with myself, which was to regard my illness, or rather what’s left of it, as non-existent. Enough time has been lost, the work must be carried on.  Whether in figures or in landscapes, I would like to express not something sentimentally melancholic but deep sorrow.  In short, I want to reach the point where people say of my work, that man feels deeply and that man feels subtly. Despite my so-called coarseness — you understand — perhaps precisely because of it. It seems pretentious to talk like this now, but that’s why I want to push on. What am I in the eyes of most people? A nonentity or an oddity or a disagreeable person — someone who has and will have no position in society, in short a little lower than the lowest. Very well — assuming that everything is indeed like that, then through my work I’d like to show what there is in the heart of such an oddity, such a nobody.  This is my ambition, which is based less on resentment than on love in spite of everything, based more on a feeling of serenity than on passion.  By persistent I mean in the first place continued labour, but also not abandoning your approach because of what someone else says. I have hopes, brother, that in a few years, and even now already, you’ll gradually see things by me that will give you some recompense for your sacrifices.  So it was a mistake a few years ago when there was a vogue among the moderns for imitating the old masters.  I just wanted to tell you that regular work will and must be resumed, come what may — and I want to add that I’m longing so much for a letter from you, and also to wish you good-night. Adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b240 V/1962Sunday morning My dear Theo, I received your letter and the 50-franc note enclosed. I thank you right heartily for both, and I’m delighted that you gave me some details about your visit. And for myself I did them to test whether now, after doing nothing but drawing for a time (around six months), I found watercolours easier, and secondly to see where I still need to do more work on the foundation or basic drawing on which everything depends.  That’s how he talked last winter, that’s how he talks now — whereupon I told him that it would please me not to visit him or see him here for the next six months. Since that sort of talk only impedes and upsets me.  You must understand this, as a result I couldn’t care less about him and I’m quite content for him finally to understand now, clearly and plainly, that I’ve taken a thorough dislike to him in recent months, and would rather not have anything to do with him.  I carry on working quietly, and he can say, to his heart’s content, all the absurd things about me that pop into his head. No, it seems to me more self-restrained, precisely because it (the artistic) is in fact in my very marrow, to go on bivouacking with my things in meadows or dunes very calmly, or to work in the studio with a model without taking the slightest notice of him.  So you must imagine me sitting at my attic window as early as 4 o’clock, studying the meadows and the carpenter’s yard with my perspective frame — as the fires are lit in the court to make coffee, and the first worker ambles into the yard. Whether I succeed in the future depends, I believe, more on my work than on anything else. Provided I can stay on my feet, well I’ll fight my fight quietly in this way and no other, that is by calmly looking through my little window at the things in nature, and drawing them faithfully and lovingly.  For the rest only adopting a defensive posture if attacked, but otherwise drawing is too dear to me for me to allow anything to distract from it.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b241 a-b V/19Wednesday morning My dear Theo, It matters greatly to me that you shouldn’t get the idea that I’m in a dejected or abnormal mood. That’s why I wrote to you already about work in my last letter, and since I have a few more things to ask in that connection I haven’t waited long before writing again. By the time you come I’ll do my best to have several watercolours done in different ways ready for you to see, then we can discuss which seems best to you. So I’ll work regularly on this every day, and continue to do so until you come.  I already feel that, and you’ll see it for yourself when you come.  I’ll make sure that several things are ready by the time you come. I think you’ll like the Fish-drying barn now that it’s with colours.  Make no mistake, old chap, I’m fully back into my normal routine, and rest assured that everything else depends on work, and I see everything as directly related to that. The new studio makes a huge difference compared to the previous one in that it’s more pleasant to work in; for posing, especially, it’s a great improvement because one can stand further back. I’m sure it will be well worth the extra rent.  Ever yours, Vincent But, again, anyone who works with love and with intelligence has a kind of armour against people’s opinion in the sincerity of his love for nature and art.  Nature is severe and hard, so to speak, but never deceives and always helps you to go forward.  When I went back to the Fish-drying barn, a luxuriant and indescribably fresh green from a wild vegetable or oilseed had shot up in the baskets filled with sand in the foreground that serve to stop the sand of the dunes blowing about. Two months ago it was all barren except for a bit of grass in the small garden, and now that rough, wild, luxuriantly sprouting green produced a most pleasant effect as a contrast to the bareness of the rest. I hope you’ll like that drawing. The vista — the view over the roofs of the village with the small church tower and the dunes — was so attractive. I can’t tell you with how much pleasure I drew it. So come soon — I believe you’ll be completely content with the change of studio when you see how infinitely better it is for my work — more space, better light, greater distance. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b242 a-d V/19My dear Theo, It was most welcome for I’m working hard and again need one or two things.  It’s impossible to say how many different green-greys there are for example — the variation is infinite. To make notes out of doors, however, or make a small scratch, a highly developed feeling for the outline is absolutely essential, as it is for working it up later.  This doesn’t come of its own accord, but firstly through observation, and then above all through persistent hard work and seeking. Some study of anatomy and perspective is also required.  In short, I wanted to make it like how I imagine the signalman with his smock and red flag must see and feel it when he thinks: how gloomy it is today. I get a lot of pleasure out of work these days, though now and again I still clearly feel the after-effects of my illness.  Of course you’ll find things in my present watercolours that should be taken out, but that must improve with time.  The whole thing makes me sick! Yet these gentlemen regularly ask me — not without a certain patronizing air — ‘whether I’ve started painting yet’.  Now I also sometimes find myself playing, so to speak, at random on a piece of paper, but I attach no more value to this than to a rag or cabbage leaf.  And if I got into debt or surrounded myself with canvases and papers daubed all over with paint without being sure of my drawing, my studio would quickly become a kind of hell, like a studio I once saw that seemed like that to me.  As it is, I always enjoy going there, and work there with pleasure. It seems to me that the painters here have a way of reasoning as follows. They say, you must do this or that — if you don’t do it, or not immediately or exactly, or if you object, the reply is: ‘So you know better than I do, do you?’ Thus immediately, sometimes within 5 minutes, there’s a conflict between you. And the situation is such that neither side can move forwards or backwards. The least odious outcome of this is if one of the two parties has the presence of mind to keep silent and in one way or another quickly slip away through some opening. And would almost say, Sapristi, the painters are a family too. That’s to say, an ill-fated association of people with conflicting interests, each one at odds with the rest, two or more of whom share the same feelings only when they join forces to obstruct another member. I hope, my dear brother, that this definition of the word ‘family’ doesn’t always apply, especially not in the case of the painters or our own family. I hope with all my heart that peace will reign in our family, and I remain with a handshake, Ever yours, Vincent Where the black is darkest in this little sketch is where the greatest strengths are in the watercolour — dark green, brown, dark grey. Well, adieu, and believe me that I sometimes laugh heartily at how people suspect me (who am really just a friend of nature, of study, of work — and of people chiefly) of various acts of malice and absurdities which I never dream of. Anyway — goodbye for now, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b243 a-c V/1962 If joining the two together is right, Van Gogh must have added to the letter a sheet whose top part is lost. Because this situation is unusual in Van Gogh’s manuscripts, we assume that both the cutting off of the paper and the crossing out of the text on p. [3r:7] were done by third parties.Saturday.  My dear Theo, I had wanted to take you to the train the next morning — but I thought you had already given me so much time that it would have been impolite if I had asked you for the following morning as well. I regard myself as privileged above a thousand others in that you remove so many barriers in my way. It goes without saying that many often can’t carry on because of the expense; well, I can hardly put into words how thankful I am to be able to keep on working steadily.  I have to try twice as hard to make up for lost time because I began later than others, and with the best will in the world I would have to give up if I didn’t have you.  Let me tell you about everything I’ve bought.  This is a valuable piece of equipment for working out of doors, in fact absolutely essential, but it’s expensive and in my mind I had postponed it until later, and until now worked with loose pieces on saucers, but they’re awkward to carry, especially if you have other items as well.  So it’s a fine thing to have, and once you have one it will last you for a long time. At the same time I bought a supply of watercolour and replaced my brushes and added some new ones.  And a supply of paint — big tubes (which work out much cheaper than small ones), but you will understand that I’ve limited myself to simple colours in both watercolour and oil: ochre (red, yellow, brown), cobalt and Prussian blue, Naples yellow, terra sienna, black and white, supplemented with some carmine, sepia, vermilion, ultramarine, gamboge in smaller tubes.  But I refrained from buying colours one ought to mix oneself. I’ll start with small things — but before the summer ends I hope to practise bigger sketches in charcoal with an eye to painting in a rather larger format later. Like this, for example. What we saw together at Scheveningen, sand — sea — sky — is something I certainly hope to express one day. As you see, this sample has a grain as coarse as a piece of sailcloth. What you brought is a nicer colour and wonderful, for example, for studies of the sides of ditches and soils. However, I’m glad to have discovered this new batch. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b244 V/19My dear Theo, In my last letter you’ll have found a little scratch of that perspective frame. I’ve just come back from the blacksmith, who has put iron spikes on the legs and iron corners on the frame.  It consists of two long legs: So by the time you next come to see me I would like the studio to have become a real painter’s studio. The fact that I couldn’t get going in January — you know that there were various reasons for that, but in the end it can be seen as a fault in the machine, a screw or a rod that wasn’t strong enough and had to be replaced by a stronger one.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b245 V/19My dear Theo, And at the same time one can say delicate things with it too — let a soft grey or green speak in the midst of roughness. I’m very glad that I have the necessary equipment, because in the past I often had to restrain myself. It opens up a much broader horizon.  But, old chap, it’s wonderful for me that I’ve once again been given so many good tools — thanks again for everything. I’ll do my best to ensure that you need have no regrets, but rather the satisfaction of seeing the progress made.  Well, good-night, it’s late, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b246 V/1962 (sheet 1) and d327 V/1972 (sheet My dear Theo, You must excuse me for writing again — it’s to tell you that I take so much pleasure in painting. Last Saturday evening I tackled something I’ve already dreamed of often. It’s a view in the flat green meadows with haystacks. A cinder road with a ditch runs straight through it. I can’t possibly draw the effect quickly here, but this shows the composition.  The ground was a sort of tapestry of green — grey — brown, but full of different shades and movement — the water of the ditch gleams in that tonal ground.  To tell you the truth, it surprises me a little. I thought that the first things would look like nothing at all, although they would improve later, I thought, though I say so myself, that they do look like something, and that rather amazes me. I believe that this is because, before I began painting, I spent so long drawing and studying perspective so that I could put together a thing I saw.  Well, since I bought my paint and materials, I have toiled and laboured, so that at the moment I’m dead tired, having done 7 painted studies. There’s also one with a figure — a mother with a child in the shadow of a big tree, in tone against a dune on which the summer sun is shining. I literally couldn’t hold myself back — I couldn’t leave it alone or take a break from it.  It’s stimulating to see something like this, because then I see how much I still have to learn.  So don’t take what I say about my own work as meaning that I’m already content with it — the opposite is true, but I believe that this much has been gained, that if something in nature strikes me I now have more means at my disposal with which to express it more forcefully.  And I don’t find it disagreeable that from now on what I make will look more appealing.  Now for my part I’m not yet thinking about ‘having a rest’. But yesterday, Sunday, I didn’t do much, at least I didn’t go out of doors. I want to make sure that even if you come as early as this winter you’ll find the studio full of painted studies.  Well, adieu, I must go out, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b247 V/1962    Sunday afternoon. My dear Theo, I’ve just received a good letter from home which truly gives me great pleasure, and from which it’s clear that your visit and the things you said about me and my work have left an impression that reassures them.  I believe this can only have desirable consequences, and I thank you in particular for the way in which you talked about me, though it seems to me you’ve praised me more about one thing and another than I yet deserve. At home they seem to be very pleased with their new surroundings, and are still full of your visit.  I am well — I feel fine not avoiding anything because of it, and just carrying on. But, as you’ll understand, it isn’t entirely over. At times, mainly in the evening when I’m tired, it troubles me, but fortunately it’s no longer such that it stops me working. The great difficulty there was to keep it clear and bring in space between the tree-trunks, which stand at different distances — and the place and relative thickness of the trunks altered by the perspective. To ensure, in short, that one can breathe and wander about in it — and smell the woods.  A lot needs to be done before I’ll be capable of working that up highly — but it’s things like this that I find most compelling in nature. As I indeed expected and counted on while I was at work, I had to buy rather a lot extra, and the money is almost used up. I’ve now painted for a fortnight from early morning to late in the evening, so to speak, and if I continued like this it would work out too expensive as long as I’m not selling.  But although I enjoy it tremendously, and probably won’t paint as much as my ambition and pleasure demand for the time being, because of the heavy costs, I reckon I’ll lose nothing by devoting much of my time to drawing, and do that just as eagerly. I am, however, in doubt — painting has proved less difficult than I expected — perhaps the course to adopt would be to concentrate every effort on toiling with the brush above all — but I declare I don’t know.  At any rate, I know for sure that drawing with charcoal is something I must now study more closely than in the past — at any rate I have enough to do and can carry on; even if I restrain myself somewhat as regards painting, I can work just as hard. If I’ve now painted quite a number of studies in a short time it’s also because I keep on working on them, and literally work all day, barely taking the time even to eat or drink.  In several studies there are small figures. I’ve also worked on a larger one and already scraped everything off twice, which you might perhaps have thought rash if you had seen the effect, but it wasn’t rash — the reason is that I feel I can do even better with more effort and study, and I’m absolutely determined to achieve that better result, whether it takes more time or less, more effort or less. Landscape the way I’ve now tackled it also definitely requires figures. These are studies for backgrounds that must be very thoroughly examined, because the tone of the figure depends on it, and the effect of the whole.  One of the things I like about painting is that for the same effort as for a drawing one takes home something that conveys the impression much better and is much more pleasing to look at. And at the same time more accurate.  In a word, it’s more rewarding than drawing. But it’s absolutely essential that one draw the objects in the correct proportion and position with some certainty before one begins.  I’m looking forward to the autumn. By then I must make sure I stock up on paint and various things again. I’m particularly fond of the effects of yellow leaves against which the green beech trunks stand out so beautifully, and the figures no less.  Do not, above all, suspect me of indifference as regards earning; I fully intend to take the shortest route to that end. Provided they are genuine and lasting earnings, of which I only see a prospect in my case if something truly good comes into my work, and not through working solely on saleability — which one pays for later — but through honest study of nature. It’s just that I would have to know that they were worth the brushes, the paint, the canvas, and that making a lot of them wasn’t a waste of money, but that the costs could be recouped. If that was or could become the case, it might be a way of enabling me to undertake more difficult things. The reason why I myself am delighted with painting is not the agreeable appearance, but the fact that it throws light on other questions of tone and form and material before which I used to be helpless, but now I can attack them with this means. I do now see, for example, more opportunity to have another try with charcoal and get a result.  But supposing it was possible to recover the costs of painted studies, I want to say to you that in principle I would have nothing against that, now I see that I’m making some headway and that it could perhaps be an exceptional opportunity.  My only objection in principle is to expending paint on things that can also be learnt with something else, while there’s still no question of selling. I don’t want to put either you or me to great expense for no good purpose, but I see clearly that the painted things have a more agreeable appearance. This makes me unsure as to what to do. My money isn’t yet exhausted, but there isn’t much left. Today is the twentieth, if I’m not mistaken. This month I’ve spent less, not more, than usual on household needs. I’ve had to spend a lot all at once on painting materials, but much of that will last for some time. But everything is expensive. I hope you can send something soon. Accept a warm handshake in thought, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent  I would rather that you make this decision, because I believe you’re more competent than I am as regards judging the financial success, and I have complete confidence that your judgement will be correct.  And if I send you something sooner or later, it will be to find out whether you have any tips to give me, not to say: I reckon this or that is saleable — for I no longer feel able to say that. And I’ll also send it in any case to keep you abreast of what I’m working on.  You told me to do my best sometime to try to work up a drawing in watercolour — I believe that, precisely as a result of painting, I’ll be more capable than in the past if I go back to watercolour.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b249 a-c V/19Saturday evening. My dear Theo, Figure painting attracts me enormously, but it still has to ripen. I need to become better acquainted with the method — what is sometimes called ‘the cookery of art’. In the beginning I’ll have to scrape off a great deal — and often make a new start – but I feel that I’m learning as a result, and that it gives me a new, fresh view of things.  What you say about their new surroundings is most interesting. I certainly would like to try doing that kind of old church and churchyard with sandy graves and old wooden crosses.  I always have in mind the idea of moving to the country if an opportunity arises, if circumstances suggest it. Although I have an abundance of material here — the woods, the beach, the Rijswijk meadows close by, and thus literally a subject at every footstep. It would also be for the sake of living more cheaply. But at the moment there’s no particular reason, as far as I can see, so there’s no urgency.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b248 V/1962 Letter headed: ‘Zaturdag avond’. In earlier editions this Saturday was said to be 19 August 1882. Roland Dorn correctly proposed 26 August 1882, though without any supporting arguments. See exhib. cat. Vienna 1996, p. 96 (n. 1Sunday morning My dear Theo, I’ve just received your very welcome letter and want to reply immediately, since today I’m having a bit of a rest anyway. I thank you for it, and for the enclosure and for one or two things you say in it.  And for your description of the scene with the workmen in Montmartre, which I found most interesting, because you give the colours as well so that I can see it — many thanks.  Yesterday evening I was occupied with an area of woodland with a slight upward slope covered in rotting and dead beech leaves. The ground was lighter and darker red-brown, all the more so because of the cast shadows of trees that threw bands across, weaker or stronger, half blotted out. The problem, and I found it to be most difficult, was to get the depth of colour — the enormous strength and fixity of that area — and yet it was only while painting that I noticed how much light there still was in that darkness. To keep it light and yet keep the glow, the depth of that rich colour, for there’s no carpet imaginable as splendid as that deep brown-red in the glow of an autumnal evening sun, although tempered by the wood.  While making it I said to myself: let me not leave before there’s something of an autumn evening in it, something mysterious, something with seriousness in it.  As you see, I’m immersing myself in painting with all my strength — I’m immersing myself in colour — I’ve held back from that until now, and don’t regret it. If I hadn’t drawn I would never have felt or tackled a figure that looks like an unfinished terracotta. But now, I feel I’m on the high seas — painting must proceed with all the strength that we can muster.  If I work on panel or canvas, the costs go up again — everything is so expensive — paint is expensive too, and is used up so quickly. Well, these are drawbacks that all painters face — we must see what’s possible. I know for sure that I have a feeling for colour that will develop more and more, that painting is in my very marrow. I appreciate it enormously that you support me so loyally and strongly. I think of you so often — I would so much like my work to be substantial, serious, manly, and for it to give you pleasure as soon as possible.  Accept a handshake in thought, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent As you see, in the scratch of the seascape there’s a blond, soft effect, and in the woods a more sombre, serious mood. I’m glad that both of these exist in life. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b250 V/1962 (sheet 1) and d315 V/1970 (sheet My dear Theo, But in the meantime I don’t need to paint weavers, although sooner or later I hope I’ll get round to that. Now it’s autumn in the woods — that preoccupies me.  I’ve been thinking again about the workmen in Montmartre you described in your last letter. I vaguely recalled that there was someone who did them extremely well.  I believe that through painting I’ll come to feel the light better, so that in my drawings, too, there’ll be something very different.  How much is involved before one can express something — but in that very difficulty lies a stimulus. At present hardly a day passes without my making a few things, but it isn’t yet what I really want.  Here’s a part of the woods in the evening after rain. I can’t tell you how superb that effect was in nature, with the bronze of the greenery and the fallen leaves here and there. I wish you could walk there in the evening sometime, in the superb autumn woods here. What I’ll bring out of it this year will be only a meagre harvest. Well, a few things nevertheless I hope, and with time more and more.  Meanwhile, my paint is finished. I sincerely hope you aren’t hard pressed yourself. At all events, I hope you’ll be able to send the usual on 10 Sept. This afternoon I must go to the potato market — it’s impossible to paint there because of the crowd — they’re enough trouble already. One ought to be allowed to enter any of the houses and sit down at the windows without further ado. Anyway, it’s Saturday evening, and so there’s bound to be something to do that makes a typical scene.  Wishing you the very best — be assured that I think of you every day. Adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b251 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I’ve just received your letter and the 50 francs enclosed, for which many thanks.  Well, I hope that the small bench, even if not yet saleable, will show you that I have nothing against tackling subjects with something agreeable or pleasant about them, which are thus more likely to find buyers than things with a more sombre sentiment.  I’m adding another to the small bench as a pendant, also a part of the woods. Well, there’s no need to take it personally, because these people aren’t malicious, but they don’t understand anything about it, and probably think someone like me mad when they see me doing a drawing with great scratches and lines which they can make nothing of.  I love it so much, sketching on the street, and, as I wrote in my last letter, I’m determined to achieve a certain standard in it.  I’m full of new pleasure in things because I have fresh hope of myself being able to make something with some soul in it.  What you write about the money that you lent and didn’t get back is certainly a disaster. From this I still have to pay for paint and buy a new supply, so by 20 Sept. I’ll definitely be running short. But I’ll vary the work a little and manage to get by. But remember that something extra will of course help me make extra progress — more successfully than otherwise. A great deal is required and everything’s expensive. But in any event I’m doubly grateful to you, and count myself more fortunate than many that things are as they are with the money, and I assure you I’m doing my best to make sure I make progress with it.  Today I’ll go to the ordinary Monday market again about the time they’re taking down the stalls to see if there’s something to sketch.  Ever yours, Vincent I thank you for sending while you yourself are so hard pressed.  I need it twice as badly, because the autumn goes so quickly and it’s the finest season to work in.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b252 V/1962, d321 V/1972, private collection, auction Monte Carlo, 18 July 2012My dear Theo, When the pink was close enough, the fellow on the horse went into the sea and returned with the anchor. Then the men were carried onto the beach on the backs of fellows in high waders, and there was a noisy welcome for each arrival.  When they were all ashore, the crowd trooped off home like a flock of sheep or a caravan, with the fellow on the camel, I mean the horse, rising above them like a tall wraith. Naturally, I tried to sketch the various events with my full attention.  Ever yours, Vincent I’m so concerned that you yourself might perhaps be in serious difficulties as a result of what you wrote to me about, and do hope that it will be settled.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b253 a V/19My dear Theo, We’re having very beautiful bad weather at present — rain, wind, thunderstorms — but with splendid effects, that’s why I find it beautiful, but it does feel raw, by the way.  The time that one can sit outside is already getting decidedly shorter, and it’s important to make the most of it before winter comes.  Towards winter I empty the studio, namely take the studies off the walls and obstacles out of the way, so that I have a good space for working with models.  I feel that I need a host of figure studies, including Scheveningen ones.  When the opportunity arises I’d like to have the studies back that you don’t want to keep from among those you have, that is when there’s an opportunity to send them. If there’s something you would like to keep, or if there’s something you would like among what I have here, you only have to say so, for I regard it all as belonging to you. But if I ask for it back it’s because what one does directly from the model is often needed for watercolours, for example. But there’s no hurry, only don’t throw them away even if they’re not very beautiful, because everything is of use.  Adieu, believe me, with a handshake, Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b254 V/1962 (sheet 1), b253 b V/1962 (sheet 2) and d316 V/1970 (sheet 3)My dear Theo, It’s splendid outdoors. The leaves are all manner of bronze colours — green, yellow, reddish — all warm and rich.  The courtyard and all that coal were so beautiful that I couldn’t resist them, although this week I wanted to draw because of the paint.  I would very much like, and am working towards this, to put things in my studio that will remind me when I see them each morning of this or that outdoors. So that I immediately know what to do with the day — and immediately take pleasure in something, or have the feeling: I must still go here or there sometime.  As regards sending you a painted study, I have nothing against that — but before I do, we must agree on a couple of things.  So you must make no judgement about my colour on the basis of what I can send now.  And if I would really prefer to wait until things are riper before sending, it’s because I believe I’ll change a great deal in colour. And in composition too. Well, I believe that you’ll take the same view and will naturally take these things into consideration. But write and tell me what you’d like me to do, and rest assured that as regards sending or not sending yet I’ll do what seems best to you.  But what I would like most of all would be for you to see everything together — is there any possibility that you could come again in the winter sometime?  I believe that one thinks much more healthily when the ideas arise from direct contact with things than when one looks at things with the aim of finding this or that in them.  It’s the same with the question of the use of colour. There are colours that are naturally beautiful seen together, but I do my best to make it as I see it, before I set to work to make it as I feel it. And yet, feeling is a big thing, and without that one would produce nothing. Sometimes I can yearn for harvest time, that is, the time when I’ll be so permeated by the study of nature that I myself will create something in a painting, yet analyzing things isn’t a burden to me or something I dislike doing. It’s already late — I sleep so badly at present — but it’s that wonderful nature of autumn that’s on my mind, and the worry about getting something out of it.  But how are things with you? I do hope you don’t have too many worries, because that doesn’t help really. I believe that I would soon be miserable if I didn’t have so much fresh air and enjoyed painting less. But being outdoors and working on something that stimulates are things that renew and sustain one’s strength. It’s only at times when I’m overtired that I feel thoroughly wretched, yet as to my health, I believe I’ll recover.  Adieu, accept a handshake in thought, and write and tell me what I should do — send you a painted study, or not yet. And rest assured that I think of you every day, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b255 V/19My dear Theo, Your latest letter with the enclosure reached me in good order, and I thank you right heartily for it. I was and even still am in a bit of a spot — that is, with a view to painting. There are all kinds of costs involved.  But that’s also partly because many of the things that I begin don’t come off, and then one has to start again and the effort comes to nothing, except that this is the way to make progress, and that one must persevere.  Now, as regards this study — if it’s the case that, on seeing it and knowing that I have many others as well as this one, you don’t regret enabling me to make it, then I’ll be content and shall carry on in good heart. If you’re disappointed, remember that I started only a short time ago; if you’re pleased, so much the better for me, for I would so much like to be able in time to send you something that gave you pleasure.  If people visit me, then at least their impression is original, but I don’t like opinions based on what people say.  Yes — if it were so that I could do exactly what I wanted, I would take up painting on a somewhat larger scale and, above all, work much more with a model. I draw many figures in my spare moments. The small figure in this study is actually there simply and solely for the size, so that if I do use the study I can find the proportion of any figure, more or less.  Of course, a proper figure is a very different matter and involves a great deal more.  It’s also there to provide an accent. Make no mistake, old chap, I send you this because, since you said nothing about it, I didn’t know what to do. Of course I intend something very different from this, and I’m sending it in the same way that I make a scratch sometimes, to give you an idea of what I’m working on. Ever yours, Vincent Another thing, you understand that I could do some things differently, for example some branches &c., if I painted them again — but I think that one shouldn’t tinker with studies if they’re to be of any use. They should be hung up in the studio just as they come out of the woods. For some they may be less pleasing, but there’s more of his impression in them for the painter himself.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b256 V/19My dear Theo, Just a word to say that your letter arrived in good order, I thank you heartily for the contents. Be that as it may, I’m working on a large watercolour of it.  I did this scratch half in the dark, but perhaps it can give you an idea of the composition. Once it has been put together, something like this can be quickly scribbled down. Putting it together was less easy, and I don’t claim that it stands now as I wanted to have it. I would enjoy painting it with figures the length of roughly one foot, or slightly less, with the composition then a little broader.  However, I don’t know whether I’ll do it. I’d need a large canvas, and if it didn’t work there might be considerable costs involved. I also think — although I would greatly enjoy it — that I’ll come to things like that of my own accord, by continuing to do types of figures. Then later it will come naturally from the studies from the model, either in this or another form, but with the same sentiment.  I’m becoming more and more aware of how useful and very necessary it is to keep studies from the model. Though they have less value for others, the person who has made them recognizes the model in them, and things are brought vividly to mind again. When there’s an opportunity, remember to send some of the old studies back to me. I hope in time to use them to make more beautiful things. It goes without saying that there were wonderful colours in the group of figures of which I’m sending you a black scratch — blue smocks and brown jackets, white, black, yellowish worker’s trousers, faded shawls, an overcoat turned greenish, white caps and black top hats, muddy paving-stones and boots contrasting with pale faces or ones weathered by the elements. And that’s where painting or watercolouring comes in. Well, I’m toiling away at it. I count on you to write again, of course, but thank you again for sending the money in good time, which is badly needed if I’m to carry on vigorously. Adieu, old chap, accept a hearty handshake in thought, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent There’s a little more foreground in the watercolour — here the figures are too far forward and one’s eye doesn’t grasp the foreground enough. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b257 V/19Sunday. My dear Theo, How beautiful it is outdoors — I’m doing my best to capture autumnal effects. I’m writing to you in great haste, I assure you that there’s a lot involved in compositions with figures, and I’m very busy. It’s like weaving: you have to give it all your attention to keep the threads apart; you must control and keep an eye on several things at once.  The small drawing of the beach is more finished than the others because it was used to determine the size, while the others are less watercolour. Well, I sincerely hope your pockets aren’t too empty — it’s so very beautiful these days that I must get something of it on paper.  Adieu, and write as soon as you can, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b258 V/1962, d278 V/1971, d277 V/19My dear Theo, But on such days it would be nice to look up a friend or to be in the company of one, and on such days one sometimes has an empty feeling if one can’t go anywhere and nobody comes.  Yet it’s precisely then that I feel what the work is; how, regardless of approval or disapproval, it gives tone to life, and how on days when one would otherwise feel melancholy one is glad to have a will.  The way I feel, I’m looking forward to the winter, it’s a marvellous season if you can work regularly. I hope that it’ll make more headway.  I don’t need to tell you that I sincerely hope you’ll receive the you know what. As you know, I’ve carried on longer with painting and watercolouring than first planned, and now I must scrimp and save. But we’ll get through that, and even more it can be no reason to slacken off. I’m varying it now by working a good deal with models, though that also mounts up — but I’m filling my portfolios as I empty my wallet. Should you not have all of the normal sum towards the twentieth then send a part, but I would prefer to receive it a day earlier rather than later, since it works out that on that day I have to pay the rent for the week.  But how little spring and summer we’ve had here. It sometimes seems to me as if there has been nothing in between, between last autumn and this one now, but that may be because the time in between was when I was ill. By the way, I feel normal again now, except when I’m very tired, then I sometimes have a day or half a day when I’m indescribably faint and weak, much more so than in the past. But I no longer let it disturb me, for it annoys me too much and is too inconvenient, since there’s too much to do. It often helps, for example, if I take a brisk walk to Scheveningen, or something like that.  Well, do write again towards the twentieth. This time I’ve had to get in Whatman again and brushes. You can’t imagine how many things one needs sometimes. Well, that goes for every painter. In thought a handshake, and believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b260 V/19Sunday afternoon My dear Theo, Your letter and the enclosure gave me very great pleasure, I don’t need to tell you that. It’s just what was needed and is a mighty help to me.  I can agree entirely with what you say about times one occasionally has when one seems to be deadened to the things of nature, or when nature no longer seems to speak to us.  At the moment a wonderful effect can be seen from the window of my studio. The city with its towers and roofs and smoking chimneys stands out as a dark, sombre silhouette against a horizon of light. The light, though, is only a broad strip; above it hangs a heavy shower, more concentrated below, above torn by the autumn wind into great tufts and clumps that float off. But that strip of light makes the wet roofs glisten here and there in the sombre mass of the city (in a drawing you would lift it with a stroke of body-colour), and ensures that, although the mass all has the same tone, you can still distinguish between red tiles and slates.  Schenkweg runs through the foreground as a glistening line through the wet, the poplars have yellow leaves, the banks of the ditch and the meadow are deep green, figures are black.  But I believe it’s a positive thing and of great importance that one should try to develop one’s powers of thought and will.  Adieu, old chap, thanks for what you sent, and a hearty handshake.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b259 V/19My dear Theo, I found it curious to hear from him of several experiences that were roughly or exactly the same as my own. But anyway.  As I’ve written to you before, I often long for you. If I saw more of you and we were able to discuss the work more, I could make several things that should be possible to make from the studies I have. I’m convinced of that. That’s exactly why I find it such a pity that I don’t get on better with painters, and, as I wrote to you in the past, that on a rainy day like today one can’t just sit cosily by the stove, look at drawings or prints and liven each other up that way. Well, old chap, and I promise you this for when you come, apart from the watercolours and painted studies, I’ll ask you to take the trouble to look through a portfolio with one hundred drawn studies — all figures. I have them already, especially if I include some old ones. In the interval between now and your visit, however, I’ll try to make better ones to replace others that can be left out, and try to put even more variety into them. Adieu in the meantime, I sincerely wish you good fortune and happiness, and believe me, with a handshake in thought, Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b261 V/19621 Nov. My dear Theo, Both have their faults, which will ruin things if one doesn’t combat them. There’s something of a reproach in his plea, and it isn’t without some melancholy that he speaks, and as one fighting against the indifference he finds intolerable. It gives me encouragement, and it truly does me good to hear someone talk like that for once.  I say that it’s a terrible pity that here there’s no enthusiasm, so to speak, for the art that’s most suitable for the common people.  If the painters were to close ranks to ensure that their work (which, after all, is made for the people, in my view — at least I believe that is the highest, noblest vocation for any artist) could also come into the hands of the people and was put within everyone’s reach, that would be something that would produce the same results as were produced in the first years of The Graphic.  Ever yours, Vincent I hope to hear from you in the coming days, I received a good letter from home.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b262 V/19My dear Theo, If I could do my trials before you come, then we could discuss what to do with them at that time. I think it possible that within a relatively short time there may be a demand for employees for illustration, more so than at present.  I’m trying to gather these together, as you know, and will see in due course.  Naturally, while working one always feels and ought to feel a sort of dissatisfaction with oneself, a desire to be able to do it much better, but still it’s delightful and enjoyable to gradually assemble all kinds of figures — although the more one makes, the more one realizes one needs.  And when you consider that for what I need, namely 30 strong studies, say, I would have to work quite a few mornings, it would cost me too much. But I’ll find a better opportunity sometime. Two things that remain eternally true and complement each other, in my view are: don’t snuff out your inspiration and power of imagination, don’t become a slave to the model; and, the other, take a model and study it, for otherwise your inspiration won’t take on material form. Ever yours,  Vincent. Be this as it may, opposing in words is a complete side issue, I believe, and what everyone who considers the matter important should do in his own circle is to try to make or help to make something.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b263 a-b V/19My dear Theo,  As you see, I’ve scrawled this print as simply as possible — I’ll be content if there’s anything in it that brings to mind the old lithographs from the time when there was more zest in this branch of art than now. But you see more clearly in business matters than I, and we can talk about this when the opportunity arises.  Above all, give me any information you can get about the process. What should one work on with autographic ink? Can everything drawn in autographic ink be printed? &c.  Ever yours, Vincent If at all possible, send no later than the tenth, for I’ve had extra expenses here for one thing and another. A hundred times more important to me than the process are the drawings themselves. I work as much with models as my purse allows, for you understand that one must have ammunition in the form of studies if eventually, once one has started illustrating, one wants to keep it up. And from that more important things also develop.  So I can’t say this too often: it’s more important that I build up a stock of drawings than that I rush or chivvy myself to find employment, although it would be most welcome.  But nothing is lost if they’re not immediately accepted, and I believe that later, with more drawings in stock, I may get a better result.  Also because it wouldn’t surprise me if the demand for draughtsmen becomes ever more evident. He seemed rather surprised that I came back with the drawing a few hours after I had bought some from him. Would you also like to have an impression with a bigger margin? Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b265 V/1962Tuesday. My dear Theo This seems to me as clear as daylight but, as I say, last night I was fretting that perhaps you might have seen it as a step of a very different nature, for I found it strange not to have a letter yet.  Well, I hope it will turn out that I needn’t have worried.  I hope, on the contrary, that you’ve been successful with your enquiries about the same matter, i.e. can say something about processes. I think it would be bold if we were to have a few of these sheets printed at our own expense. That would make us more credible to the managers of the illustrated magazines.  Now it isn’t at all my idea that what we might have printed should be exploited by me or you. I had and have not the slightest thought of that, but only that when one presents oneself somewhere to ask for work it’s as well to be able to show something of one’s work. That saves words and is more practical.  The fact that I consider it not unlikely that in time I’ll make things that will come into the hands of the public is something that leaves me quite cold and that I don’t in the least regard as pleasing. Two reasons would bring me to that: first, if I were employed by an illustrated magazine and would then of course have to make what was required; second, something to consider later, although I do indeed think about this, when sooner or later I have something that forms a whole and has an import and says something, then I might be persuaded to publish it myself if I couldn’t find anyone else, although not without informing or consulting you.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b266 V/19My dear Theo, I’m going to go and talk to Smulders tomorrow to get the stones from him. I must tell you that I would find it extremely pleasing if I could get around to making a large series sometime. It’s bitterly cold here. Snow and frost, but very beautiful for all that. I’ve looked for them here in town and can’t find a single issue. The sooner I receive them the more valuable they’ll be to me, since I’m just now going into the various processes, and the reproductions in Vie Moderne may help me to get a better understanding of what can be done with them. Because of the loss of those 50 francs (for I fear they’re gone), both you and I have had a setback in carrying out these experiments, but don’t let it discourage us. How I wish you could see the drawings I’m working on at the moment.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b267 V/19Wednesday morning My dear Theo, I’d very much like to know as soon as possible what impression they make on you. I still plan to retouch them on the stone, and would like to have your opinion for that. The drawing was done not only with lithographic crayon; the strengths were reinforced with autographic ink as well. Anyway, as a result I’ve seen that where it has taken it gives good strengths of black, with which I hope to be more successful later on. Then, when the printer has time, we’re going to experiment by putting on a kind of wash during printing, and will try out various types of paper and different sorts of printing ink. I hope that these two stones will improve further through the retouching after the two studies, done directly from the model, which I still have.  No news yet about the letter. The people at the post office here know nothing about it and blame it on Paris. Adieu, I sincerely wish you all the best, and a handshake in thought, believe me always Ever yours, Vincent In the drawing of the Coffee drinker the black was much more broken by the direction of the hatching. It has now become dull, unfortunately, but this can probably be corrected. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b268 V/19My dear Theo, I just said, people who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. I fear, Theo, that it will come about that many who have sacrificed the old for the sake of the new will deeply regret it. Especially in the realm of art.  Adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours,  Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b269 V/1962 Josserand is the father of three daughters who, together with his wife, spend so much to keep up appearances in their bourgeois circle that he has to work at night as well as doing a day job as a cashier. For the address writing (chapter 2), see pp. 24-25. Cf. also Sund 1992, p. 6Sunday My dear Theo, Conversely, I know of few good drawn or painted portraits of writers. On this point most painters also lapse into the conventional and make of a writer a man who simply sits at a table full of papers, or don’t even go that far and make him a gentleman with a collar and tie, and moreover a face without any particular expression.  And I, I was silent — How you would feel something like that — how well you would paint it if you wanted to. It was extraordinarily beautiful this morning, and it did me good to go for a long walk, for with all the drawing and the lithographs I’d hardly been out of doors this week.  Tomorrow I hope to learn various things about printing that the printer’s going to show me. I would love to learn how to print myself. I think it quite possible that this new method will revive lithography. I believe that a way could be found of uniting the advantages of the new with the old method. One can never predict anything for certain, but who knows whether it might not lead to new magazines being founded again. Monday Let cares like a wild deluge come, And storms of sorrow fall, May I but safely reach my home, One can’t present oneself as somebody who can be of benefit to others or who has an idea for a business that’s bound to be profitable — no, on the contrary, it’s to be expected that it will end with a deficit and yet, yet, one feels a power seething inside one, one has a task to do and it must be done. Yet this is the time to combine and to speak. Or is it rather that, given that many have fallen asleep and don’t wish to be woken up, one must try to confine oneself to things that one can finish alone, which one faces alone and has sole responsibility for? So that those who sleep can go on sleeping and rest. Now you see that this time I too am expressing more intimate thoughts than normally; you’re to blame for this, because you did the same.  Ever yours,  Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b270 a-b V/19My dear Theo, If I were a man of means, I wouldn’t hesitate to decide, I would say, Onward, and be quick about it.  I see that with persistence and perseverance it could become something which I believe could be absolutely not superfluous but decidedly good and useful.  So when it comes down to daring and self-sacrifice and venturing on something that doesn’t have to be done for gain but because it’s useful and good: one must keep one’s trust in one’s fellow man and fellow countrymen in general. Before I go any further, though, this — I personally don’t want to have any more to do with the business of prints for the people beyond the making of them, in the event that some such venture is started. It must be a matter of charity, not of bookshops. In my opinion the following would have to be laid down: Given that it’s useful and needful for Dutch drawings to be made, printed and circulated, intended for workers’ dwellings, farmhouses, in a word, for every working man, several parties undertake to do their utmost, to exert their best efforts for this goal. This association not to be dissolved before the venture is completed, and endeavouring to carry it out as practically and as well as possible.  The price of the prints is not to exceed 10 or at the most 15 cents. The amount raised by sales will be used first to reimburse those who advanced money, second to give everyone who has supplied a drawing an amount to be determined later that is the same for each draughtsman.  When these payments have been made, what remains will be used for new publications to carry on the work.  Immediately after the publication of the first series of 30 there must be a debate and decision on whether or not to continue, and at that point, but not before, whoever so wishes may withdraw from the association.  This is the idea that took shape in my mind — now I say to you: How to do it? Will you take part?  I refuse it for myself personally, because I would only pursue it alone if the kind of association I’ve described to you couldn’t be established. At that point I would have to see what more I could do. For the present I share my thoughts about the matter with him, and ask him as I ask you, couldn’t we start something of that kind? Ever yours,  Vincent Now something else. One must be prepared for what it entails.  30 stones, printing wages, paper. What do they cost? I don’t know exactly, but I think 300 guilders would go a long way. The drawings are the contributions by the members of the association who cannot give any money. I’m ready to take on all of them if no one else presents himself, but I would rather that better people than I took it on.  Sending the first 30 into the world seems to be desirable in any event, and I would be glad to carry on with it even if no enthusiasts came forward to make drawings for the time being, because showing that series to artists who could do it better than I might persuade them to take part. Many only want to start when they know for sure that it’s serious, and refuse to become involved as long as the first steps haven’t been taken.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b271 a-c V/19My dear Theo, This time the autographic ink ran badly and that had to be corrected later, but there were still black passages everywhere. But look, for example, at the left leg with the muddy boot. There one can see that fabrics can be rendered with this process and curious effects obtained.  You write about the question of making drawings in a smaller format. I think it good of you that you speak about this question in a calmer manner than others, who have sometimes said the same thing to me in a very different way and told me, if you don’t work smaller then this will happen and that will happen. Talking about it like that seems to me premature and superficial, and I can’t believe that what they say is true. Do you know what I think — all formats have their pros and cons. In general, for my own study, I definitely need to have the figure in fairly large proportions, so that head, hands, feet aren’t too small and one can draw them robustly. Without a specific reason I would think it less important than with a specific reason.  If it’s so that, were I to send you some figures, say half the size of the last ones, you’d be willing to make new attempts without being able to say at this stage specifically where or what for, that would be reason enough for me to make them.  What I just said is only to point out to you how I’ve tried from the outset to maintain a certain order in my work, set a sort of rule for myself, not to be a slave to that rule but because it helps one to think more clearly.  Reducing a certain figure to half the size, for example, isn’t difficult at all — although sometimes one loses something of what makes it distinctive — but sometimes the figure gains by it. At any rate, I’ll send you a few shortly, but if you have something particular in mind for them, tell me what they’re for — that will help me in the choice of my figures. Thank you again for what you sent. What I wrote to you in my last letter about a plan for making prints for the people is something to which I hope you’ll give some thought one day. I don’t have a fixed plan about this myself as yet, only in order to have it clear in my mind I’ll have things to do relating both to the drawings themselves and to the process of reproduction.  But I don’t doubt the possibility of doing something like this, nor its usefulness. Nor can I doubt that people can be found whose heart would be in it. In short, I believe it could be done in such a way that no one would need regret having taken part. With a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent In the illustrated magazines they undergo something like the small tower in the distance that looks very small and insignificant, and when one gets up close proves to be an imposing mass (I mean, only a small part of their work is made public).  Anyway, some paintings in their huge frames look very substantial, and later one is surprised when they actually leave behind such an empty and dissatisfied feeling. On the other hand, one overlooks many an unpretentious woodcut or lithograph or etching now and then, but comes back to it and becomes more and more attached to it with time, and senses something great in it.  Now whether, for my part, I have to work in a smaller or larger format makes relatively little difference to me, but what the illustrated magazines ask is only part of what I demand of myself. Of myself I firmly demand that I can make the figure of a size such that head, hands and feet don’t become too small and the details remain clear.  This is still very far from being what I require of myself, but for that very reason I must stand firm on that point.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b272 a-b V/19My dear Theo, First of all a Sower. A big old chap, a tall dark silhouette against a dark ground. Then one of the old boys with short jackets and big, old top hats one meets sometimes in the dunes.  It’s always very tempting to draw a figure at rest — expressing action is very difficult, and in the eyes of many the effect is ‘more pleasing’ than anything else. So you see that my attitude to it all is chiefly this, that for my part I’m trying to work on it. It seems to me that the drawings themselves have greater urgency than even the reproduction.  I’ll also be careful about talking about the matter, because I believe that people generally act more practically in a small group than when many are involved.  Too many cooks spoil the broth. How I wish we were together a little more. Do you know why I, for my part, don’t doubt that I could do it? You know from physics that an object immersed in a fluid loses as much weight as the specific gravity of the amount of fluid that the body displaces. This is why some things float, and why even those that sink are lighter under water than in the air. Something similar — a kind of fixed law of nature — seems to exist as regards working, in the sense that when one is engaged in it, one feels more capacity for work than one knew one had, or rather actually did have. You would experience that too if you set yourself to painting sometime. At first it seems something unattainable, a hopeless thing, later it becomes clear, and I believe that you would see this in my work too.  I often think I’d like to be able to spend more time on landscape proper. I often see things that I find remarkably beautiful, which moreover make me say instinctively, I’ve never seen this or that painted like that.  But what spirit and what love is in them, and yet how freely and gaily they are done. Misconceptions as to the intentions of the great landscape painters are to a large extent the cause of the trouble. Almost no one knows that the secret of beautiful work is to a large extent good faith and sincere feeling.  Many can’t help it that they aren’t deep enough, and act in good faith, in so far as they have good faith.  Write again soon, and believe me Ever yours,  Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b273 a-b V/1962   Doyce then starts up a business with Clenham, but he cannot forget his invention. Clenham sees that ‘the thing was as true as it ever was’ and in the name of Doyce he resumes the battle – unsuccessfully – with the Circumlocution Office. Clenham makes a bad investment with their joint capital and ends up in jail. On Clenham’s release, Doyce forgives him for everything that has happened: ‘First, not a word more from you about the past ... I have done a similar thing myself, in construction, often. Every failure teaches a man something, if he will learn’ (See Dickens 1979, book 1, chapter 10, p. 114; book 1, chapter 16, p. 185; book 2, chapter 8, p. 500; book 2, chapter 34, p. 797). Van Gogh says that Doyce speaks these words on his departure from England, but that does not fit with the course of the storMy dear Theo, Of course I can’t read a book about Paris without instantly thinking of you. I also can’t read a book about Paris without to some extent also finding The Hague in it, which is admittedly smaller than Paris but still a court city with corresponding morals. When you say in your last letter ‘what a riddle there is in nature’, I echo your words. Life in the abstract is already a riddle, reality turns it into a riddle within a riddle.  And who are we to solve it? All the same, we ourselves form a particle of it, of the society of which we ask, Where is it going, to the devil or to God?  As for my plan with the lithographs, I’ve thought about it a lot; if that had been all, I fear I wouldn’t have made any progress, for what is there to think about?  You needn’t worry that I’ll undertake anything else for the time being apart from the drawings themselves — I must wait a little before doing trials with lithography until I have some money to get on with them. But I believe it could come to something.  From time to time I have a great longing to be in London again. I’d so very much like to know more about printing and drawing on wood.  I feel a power in me that I must develop, a fire that I may not put out but must fan, although I don’t know to what outcome it will lead me, and wouldn’t be surprised if it was a sombre one.  In times like these, what should one wish for? What is the happiest lot in these circumstances?  Sometimes I long so much to do landscape, just as one would for a long walk to refresh oneself, and in all of nature, in trees for instance, I see expression and a soul, as it were. A row of pollard willows sometimes resembles a procession of orphan men.  Adieu, old chap, with a handshake in thought. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b264 V/19My dear Theo, That said, what then? And in general his words are the diametrical opposite of those of the publishers in this Xmas issue — the whole producing a result in the following form. As with The Graphic, so with more, many more things in the sphere of art.  Moral greatness diminishes, material greatness comes in its place.  You ask about my health. What I had last summer really has gone completely, but I’m a little dejected at present, which is combined with other moments, when I’m making progress with the work, when I feel very cheerful, so that I find it rather like being a soldier who doesn’t feel at home in the guardhouse and thinks to himself: why must I be here in the cooler when I would be more in my rightful place in the ranks?  I mean something is weighing on me, since I feel a power in myself which, due to the circumstances, can’t develop as it otherwise would, and the result is that I’m often wretched. A kind of internal battle over what I must do. Not so easy to resolve as may have appeared at first.  I wish I had a position through which I could make progress. Many positions that might lie within my reach would lead me to something entirely different from what I mean. They lie beyond my reach for, although I might be taken on initially, with time I wouldn’t be thought right for them. I would be dismissed and I would myself give notice, as with Goupil.  Yes, but if their lordships the managers could follow their publications and see how thousands eagerly pick up the magazine and then, when they put it aside, instinctively have a feeling of dissatisfaction and disappointment, maybe they’d be less keen to badger people. The public — yes, on the one hand they’re dissatisfied, but material greatness also garners applause all the same. But don’t forget that this is only a straw fire, and that those who applaud generally do so only because it has become the talk of the town. On the day after the party there’ll be an emptiness and silence, and indifference after all that noise. And now, everything’s gone — again the material in place of the moral. I would like something more succinct, something simpler, something sounder; I would like more soul and more love and more heart. What sometimes saddens me is this — in the past, when I began, I thought when I’ve got this or that far I’ll get a position here or there, and I’ll be on a straight path and set for life. Undertaking something oneself is possible only if one encounters interest and cooperation. This brings us to another area. Excuse me if I tell you my thoughts and continue to do so. If you don’t have time to write and don’t reply immediately, at least you’ll know when we meet again what preoccupies me, and perhaps we’ll find a passable path. I thought this folder from The Graphic was something through which one can say more clearly what one means, and that’s why I write this for the present. With a handshake in thought. Ever yours,  Vincent.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b274 a-b V/19My dear Theo, The grace is the best, I believe, but they complement each other. In the one there’s a view through the window of snow-covered furrows.  I must copy out something for you that I had in mind when working on that old man, though it doesn’t apply to it literally, since it isn’t nighttime in the drawing, for example.  Oft in the stilly night,  Ere slumber’s chain has bound me, Fond memory brings the light Of other days around me; The smiles, the tears, Of boyhood’s years, The words of love then spoken; The eyes that shone, Now dimm’d and gone,  The cheerful hearts now broken! Thus, in the stilly night,  Ere slumber’s chain hath bound me, Sad memory brings the light Of other days around me. When I remember all The friends, so link’d together, I’ve seen around me fall, Like leaves in wintry weather; I feel like one Who treads alone Some banquet-hall deserted, Whose lights are fled, Whose garlands dead, And all but he departed! Thus, in the stilly night,  Ere slumber’s chain hath bound me, Sad memory brings the light Well, I hope that you too will be able to enjoy something of nature in the coming days, either in the appearance of the short winter days or in the winter figures. For how very different passers-by on the street look in winter and in summer.  After reading your explanation I’m also left with the question: if one takes a photograph of the drawing, and then transfers the photo to zinc, is it only the drawings done on this particular paper that are suitable for this, and isn’t it possible to reproduce all drawings in black and white, even if they’re on ordinary paper? Also: doesn’t the photographer then have it in his power to reduce the format, should the drawing be larger than desirable for the format of the magazine? The latter is certainly what I would deduce from some American reproductions that appeared in Scribner’s Magazine. Well, adieu, I hope you’ll write again towards the twentieth. With a handshake in thought. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b275 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I received your registered letter in good order, and thank you warmly for sending it. From your letter I saw that you’re busy with the inventory. Good luck with it, no doubt it’s a fearsome grind.  How I wish we could spend a couple of Christmas days together, for instance — I would also dearly like to have you in my studio once more.  I, too, have been toiling quite hard recently, precisely because I was full of the Christmas feeling, and feeling isn’t enough, one must bring it into one’s work.  As long as you’re as busy as you are now, I’ll do my very best to make drawings with that in mind. Then when you’re not so busy I’ll have some more information to ask from you or from Buhot.  As for lithography, because I’ve been present several times during the printing and the preparation of the stone, I’m seriously considering making a lithograph without the aid of paper or anything else, that is simply drawing straight onto the stone itself.  Well, I hope that you’ll still be able to enjoy Christmas — still get to go for a walk and have a pleasant time.  But I fear you’ll be deep in the inventory. Still, there’s always something cheerful about working, even when the work itself isn’t that enjoyable.  Adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b276 V/19My dear Theo, Before the year ends, I feel a need to thank you again for all your help and friendship. I’ve sent you almost nothing for a considerable time, but I’m saving up for when you come some day. I’m sorry that I haven’t managed to make a saleable drawing this year — I really don’t know why it is that I haven’t managed this.  I wish you were in the studio once more. I believe I wrote to you recently that at present I’m occupied with large heads because I felt I needed to study the structure of a skull and the composition of a physiognomy more intimately.  You’ll still be busy with your inventory and I shan’t hold you up. I heartily wish you the very best in the New Year.  Will we have more luck making saleable drawings in the new year, or finding work for an illustrated magazine, say?  I continue to believe one thing: wrestling with nature is not working in vain, and though I don’t know what the result will be, there will be a result.  I agree entirely with what you wrote recently, ‘there comes a time when one has mastered drawing to the degree that the format becomes immaterial and one has the proportions in one’s head, so that one can work just as well on a large or a small scale.’  Not only do I agree about that, but on top of that I believe that one can and must raise oneself to a level where one has mastered composition, effects, chiaroscuro to the extent that one can master the most diverse themes and subjects in the field one has chosen — such as today doing a 3rd-class waiting room, tomorrow a rainy day in a poor neighbourhood, another time an almshouse for old men, then a pub or a soup kitchen.  I haven’t got that far yet, but perhaps it’s a long process precisely because I search for the root or origin of many things at the same time. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b277 V/19My dear Theo, It’s New Year’s Eve and I feel so much like having another word with you. When I wrote my last letter I spoke to you about large heads that I was working on. I was carrying out an experiment at the time, the first results of which I can now report to you, since the day before yesterday, yesterday and today I’ve had models for two drawings.  When I made the lithographs, I was struck by the fact that the lithographic crayon was very pleasant to work with, and I thought of making drawings with it.  It has one drawback, though, which you’ll understand — it’s greasy, so one can’t rub it out in the normal way. Working with it on paper, one mostly has to do without the only thing that one can use to erase on the stone itself, namely the scraper, which can’t be used with enough force on the paper because it goes through it.  And a second one, a head of an injured man with a bandage. When I compare these two heads with the others I’ve done, there’s a big difference in the strength of the effect.  So I have hopes that drawings done in this way will be suitable for reproduction using the process you’ve described to me.  Especially if the paper you sent isn’t absolutely essential for reproduction.  So I immediately tried to see which black I could use, while still sketching in my normal way.  I tried ink first, but I wasn’t satisfied with that, although I believe that in that way the effects will be better with lithographic crayon.  Well, I’m not writing about this in order to bother you in the midst of your busy days. I’m not in a hurry, and in fact it would be very welcome if I have some more time to investigate further.  But I’m writing this to you so that you’ll know that I’m toiling away heart and soul to get it good and usable.  This is also the case with Black and White. Yet fundamentally it’s one and the same. One must be able to go from the highest lights to the deepest shadows, and do so with a few simple ingredients.  2 January Adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b278 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I wrote to you yesterday, but I’m doing so again today to report the safe arrival of your letter and to thank you for it, and to tell you that what you wrote raised my spirits. I was a bit concerned that, because you’ve seen so little of my work recently, this might make you think that I’d begun to slacken off. I have in fact been slogging away lately, and am still wrapped up in various things in which I begin to see light as to how to do them, but which I haven’t yet got the hang of as I would like. In my last letter I told you I was experimenting in Black and White with lithographic crayon. And if you get a chance, speak to an expert about whether it would be possible to reproduce drawings like these (as distinct from the second question of whether these or similar ones were to their particular taste). As for their sentiment, I would like to know what YOU think about that, because, as I said, I myself can’t judge whether there’s more in them or not. But what I’d like to know from you is whether you think that this way of working would perhaps remove some of the objections you had to pencil. They’re a few ‘heads of the people’, and my intention would be to find a large number like these to try to form a sort of entity that wouldn’t be entirely unworthy of the title ‘heads of the people’. Through working hard, old chap, I hope to make something good one day. I haven’t got it yet, but I’m hunting it and fighting for it, I want something serious, something fresh — something with soul in it! Onward, onward. You’ll see clearly enough from what I’ve said above that I’m more eager to put together a serious work for reproduction than to have the satisfaction of seeing one drawing printed some day. But any information and tips as to processes are very welcome. This is only a beginning — later you’ll get fine things from me, old chap! For the time being, let me know whether you think some of the objections to using pencil alone could be removed somewhat by using crayon as well. Don’t you also agree that by making these drawings I may also indirectly learn things about lithography proper? Adieu, thanks again for your letter, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b279 V/19Dear brother, But if you, too, think it would be a good idea to look through them in advance, so that I should send them in the next few days, then I take it I can count on your bringing them back this summer, say, can’t I?, because I’ll have to work from them later.  Because I had to pay for some things at New Year I’ve now actually run out of money already, at least I have very little left. Try, if you can, to send before rather than after the tenth and I’ll be obliged to you. Adieu, old chap, I hope that the sketches will be more or less to your taste. With a handshake. Ever yours Vincent Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b280 V/19My dear Theo When someone has a meeting like that, it’s to be expected that he’ll experience conflict, especially conflict with himself, because one sometimes literally doesn’t know what one should or should not do. Yet isn’t this conflict, and even the mistakes into which one will sometimes fall, better, and doesn’t it develop us more than systematically shutting out emotions? This last is what makes many so-called strong spirits in reality weak spirits, in my view. You have my sympathy in this, and should you think it desirable, given that I too am faced by realities and can tell you what has befallen me since we last talked this over, to hear a thing or two about it, or if you want to talk about the future or confer about anything at all, I’m always entirely at your disposal. The fact that you write that you’re thinking of coming to Holland before too long is very welcome news to me. Persevering is the main issue in love once one has really started. That is if the love is requited, for if it’s definitely not requited then it’s a case in which one is literally absolutely powerless. Anyway. I thank you for your trust, and when I think it over I’m fairly at ease about the outcome. Such a thing isn’t ‘passion’, because an unfathomably deep compassion is involved. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b281 V/1962My dear Theo, I couldn’t help thinking and thinking again about it. How will people take it? Will it bring you into conflict with the world? That, too, is a question in my mind that I can’t answer, because I don’t yet know the circumstances well enough. And there’s something else, which is actually the reason for this letter and which I wanted to suggest you consider and which you’ve probably thought of yourself. For, I repeat, if she’s alone in a room, with no distraction or occupation, then I believe that could be quite fatal for her. And a kind of hospital (ordinary or private) where she had company would perhaps be preferable, provided you visited her often. It may be that all this has already been arranged; I write about it just because I don’t know anything definite in this regard. Ever yours, Vincent You’ll say that I’m spending a lot of time writing, I can’t help it, for you’ve confided in me, so I want to tell you that this didn’t fail to touch me.  It’s an odd thing about cases of this kind that it’s so extremely difficult to know how far one should go. You will experience this too. One asks oneself, should I help this woman and otherwise see only a friend in her, or should I definitely choose this woman as my wife with whom I want to live always? Is she the one? Or is she not? You see, I believe that you haven’t avoided this conflict, or perhaps you’re still in it. For were it to be otherwise, it would seem to me rather unnatural. So don’t let go of this thought, for it’s good for love to ripen so that marrying becomes very much a secondary matter. That is safer, and no one suffers harm as a result. I wanted to say one thing to you in the beginning, which you’ll understand anyway. Whether or not this puts you in difficulties, I respect the noble feelings that prompted you to help, and because I respect that I hope that if you do run up against difficulties, large or small, you’ll think me worthy of your confidence.

Later — things are definitely different — but one doesn’t forget that first moment.   That drawing shows two women in black in a dark room. One has just come home and is hanging her coat on the hatstand. The other briefly smells a primrose on the table while picking up a white piece of needlework.  I speak from my own experience, not that I reject everything to do with the present day, far from it, but still it seems to me that something from the past that was good and should have been kept is going, in art particularly, but also in life itself.  Perhaps I’m expressing things too vaguely, but I can’t put it another way — I don’t know myself what it is exactly, but it wasn’t only the Black and White that changed direction and strayed from the healthy, noble beginnings.  Rather, in general a kind of scepticism and indifference and coldness prevails, despite all the activity.  But all this is too vague and ill-defined. I don’t think about it all that much in fact, because I’m thinking about my drawings and have no time to go into it.  His woodcuts could almost pass for etchings. Even if they are weaker, what there is — doesn’t that already have enough substance to remain for ever, thus rather disproving the words too good to last? The pity of it is partly that when several people care for the same cause and work on it together, unity is strength, and united they can do more than their separate energies can, each striving in a different direction.  People strengthen each other when they work together, and an entity is formed without personality having to be blotted out by the collaboration. I think that we’ll have a real day when you come, sooner or later. Perhaps you’ll agree with me that in times of worry, such as you will certainly have now because of her illness, one can best feel the poetry of things. I long for the spring so that I can get a breath of fresh air instead of working at home, which has made me a little dull. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b284 V/193 February My dear Theo, I dearly long for your letter again, and since it’s 3 Feb. already (and it’s past the postman’s time today) I’m writing as a precaution. If it’s because you wrote a few days later it will be all right, but owing to what happened with the letter this winter I’m letting you know in case you wrote before the first. Then it might be as well if you made enquiries.  I’ve noticed that the postmen sometimes give letters for Schenkweg to people living there instead of delivering them themselves. For the postmen it’s sometimes a long way off their route, and I know this because the postman asked me to deliver something for him the other day, which of course I did — though I thought about the lost letter. Oh well.  We’ve had storms here of late, especially last night. There’ll be rough seas.  I’ve been feeling very weak of late — I fear that I’ve rather overworked myself — and those ‘dregs’ of working, those afterpains of exertion, how horrible they are. Then life has the colour of dirty water, it’s like a rubbish dump. At those times one would like to have a friend near one. Sometimes that clears up the dim mist.  On such days I sometimes worry terribly about the future and am melancholy about my work, and feel powerless. But it’s dangerous to speak too much of this or to keep thinking about it, so enough.  Not just with conté, but making the whole thing wet and letting the shadows flow, the lights heightened again. It may also be that I’ve caught a cold — but before I can really do anything I must get over this lack of energy.  NOW nearly everyone would find the first sketch very beautiful.  That even now he’s still described by many as disagreeable is something I find nearly incomprehensible.  It’s almost impossible to imagine anything deeper than his work.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b285 V/195 February My dear Theo, Many thanks for your letter and for the money. Old chap, I’m still a little weak, and I’ve had a pretty clear warning that I must be careful — my eyes sometimes seemed tired to me, but I didn’t want to imagine things. But last night, for example, there was a great discharge of the fluid one always has in the eyes and my eyelashes kept sticking together, and looking is an effort and is cloudy, so to speak.  Now and then everything outside looks spring-like, and it won’t be long before the lark sings in the meadow again.  I’ll rest for about a week or so sometime, and continue to go for walks out of doors — to get new ideas. I wanted to get something from my studies for watercolours, for instance, but that’s not working at all well at the moment.  Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b286 V/198 Feb. My dear Theo, It must be a weight off your mind that the operation has been done.  What a riddle life is, and love is a riddle within a riddle. Staying the same is the only thing that it certainly doesn’t do in a literal sense, but on the other hand the changes are a kind of ebb and flow and make no difference to the sea itself.  I’ve rested my eyes a little since I last wrote to you and felt better for it, although they still sting.  In the studies, too, one sees for oneself the agitation and a certain precision that’s diametrically opposed to the calm breadth one seeks — and yet one feels bad if one works specifically for that breadth and devotes oneself to that.  The difficulties one faces in the first phase give the studies a painful quality at times.  I don’t regard this as something that discourages me, though, because I’ve noticed it in others as much as in myself, and in them it has increasingly gone away of its own accord.  I sometimes think about experimenting with a completely different way of working, namely daring and risking more. But I don’t know whether I ought not to study the figure more directly, definitely with a model.  Sometimes I can’t understand all the same that I’m only 30 and feel so much older.  What concerns me, and what I’m responsible for, is that I make the most of the circumstances I’m in, and do my best to make progress.  As a working man, at the age of 30 one is at the beginning of a period in which one feels steadiness in oneself. As such, one feels young and full of zest.  This is why one sometimes thinks, what do I care about the world’s judgement?, and if that judgement is too much of a burden, one can shrug it off.  That is to say, one must keep hold of the general care and overseeing of the whole.  I believe that the poor and the painters have the sentiment of the weather and the changing seasons in common. Of course everyone feels that, but for the better-off they’re hardly events at all, and don’t generally make much difference to their state of mind.  I like this remark by a polder worker: ‘In the winter I suffer as much cold as the winter corn’.  I’ll follow your advice to bathe my eyes with tea if it doesn’t go away. It’s lessening, so for the present I’ll let things take their natural course. Because I was never troubled by it in the past, except this winter along with toothache, and so I believe it to be something accidental caused by my unusual exertions. And now I can bear the tired eyes when drawing better than in the beginning. Write again soon if you can, and believe me, with a handshake, Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b287 a-b V/19Dear brother, It’s Sunday again and I’m writing again. Sometimes it seems to me that I haven’t told you warmly and sincerely enough how deeply touched I’ve been by what you’ve told me of late.  Where people love sincerely and in good faith, they are blessed I believe, although that doesn’t dispel difficult times. I’m glad that my eyes are no worse, in fact already much better, but it isn’t completely over yet, and I must be careful. I must tell you, I wasn’t pleased. I sometimes find it difficult to give up a friendship, but if I were to go to a studio and had to think to myself: talk about trivia, don’t bring up anything more important, and don’t say what your real feeling is about this or that in art, then I would be more melancholy than if I had stayed away. It’s hard for me to be content with conventional friendship, precisely because I seek and persevere in sincere friendship.  I don’t think it absurd to consider it possible that there may again be a kind of periwig age in the future, for after all what’s known as the periwig age in Dutch history had its origins in the abandonment of principles and the replacement of the original by the conventional.  If you don’t know Mme Thérèse, read it sometime — I believe she’ll find it beautiful too, and be moved by it.  I hope to be able to work more regularly this week. I have the feeling that I have to work twice as hard to make up for starting late, and it’s the very sense that I’m behind others in my age that gives me no rest.  Adieu, old chap, write soon, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b288 a-b V/19Dear brother, Although I wrote only yesterday, another word today after all, firstly to thank you for your letter and for the money. It may be my imagination, if so all the better, nothing would please me more, for if there’s no significant melancholy and it disappears of its own accord that is so much the better.  But if it persists and you see that something is wrong — and I for one think that’s the course it will take — be careful, for then the situation will be more serious and the only physician for that won’t be the doctor but you.  1) both have undergone a difficult operation and weren’t entirely calm throughout that operation, despite the chloroform; 2) shortly before the operation both had huge shocks to the mind through anxiety and tension and unrest, and their morale suffered almost more than a nervous system can bear; It seems to me that these resemblances are worth noting. Ever yours, Vincent Up to today my eyes were closed by fluid each night or morning when I awoke, but last night nothing in either for the first time. There’s nothing to be seen other than that the white was a little cloudy and red, and what they call blue bags under the eyes, and that’s nearly gone too.  Original manuscriMy dear Theo, That wandering and drifting alone — — Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b289 V/19My dear Theo, But he didn’t want to do anything unless I paid him.  But now, as the result of tackling him again, I have 6 blinds and about 6 long planks.  Those blinds are now being sawn to make shutters that can be manoeuvred so that more or less light is shut out or let in as required, from above or below. From this scratch I think you’ll see that it works very nicely.  And the planks are for a big cupboard in the alcove, for storing drawings, prints, books, and as a hatstand for various smocks, jackets, old coats, shawls and hats, not forgetting the sou’wester, which I need for the models.  He’s been to the studio himself repeatedly and is certainly not a swindler, though he has a pretty sharp tongue (a bit like a Yankee). And it seems that the studio was better than he’d expected (he hadn’t seen it since July last year); at any rate I got it approved while in the studio, and more easily even than I expected.  As you know, I already had something in front of the windows, namely canvas stretched on laths. They’re no longer needed now, but will be highly desirable as backgrounds, with darker or lighter material stretched over them, when one wants to draw heads, for example. You see now that I’ll be able to cover over one or two windows completely and thus obtain one general light that will make the effects much stronger. Otherwise they’d be neutralized by reflections or different lights.  The job would have been entirely out of the question if I’d had to pay for it myself, since it was expensive, and I’m very pleased with it.  Yet how miserable today’s houses often are compared with what they could be if people made an effort to furnish them pleasantly.  which wouldn’t have been that much more if we hadn’t been dealing with blinds that already existed. The difference is only that there’s a frame around each square of light, and the blinds are thus slightly smaller.  Noble blade, ignoble scabbard — Well — write soon if you haven’t written already, and believe me, with a handshake, Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b290 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Just a word to report the safe arrival of your letter and to thank you for it.  There are many loves in one love — and things are very different again when the woman regains her health — and that’s wonderful too. Continuing and persevering is the main thing; if you want variety you should remain faithful. And if you want to see many women you should confine yourself to one and the same. Spring is coming along well here.  Window 1 now (in the scratch) has its lower part closed off, and the rest too in part. Now looks like the door of a room in an almshouse, say.  Window 2 has its top part closed off and looks like a window where the figures sit. The background on the left is dark because window 3 is completely closed.  I was often desperate when, for example, I saw a little old lady pottering about in a small room and there was a character and something mysterious in the figure that vanished completely when I had that same old lady in the studio.  Equally, the orphan man, say, was much finer in a dark passage than in my studio. And this was most regrettable, and the surface area of those 3 windows was so large that it couldn’t be dimmed sufficiently with screens or cardboard. But now I’m in the process of overcoming one thing and another.  However formless the scratch may be, it was done immediately from nature (but in great haste) while the work on the windows was going on, and you’ll see from it that one can now obtain nice effects and vary them greatly. And I prefer to send it to you rather than explain the matter in words.  Anyway, I now have the light in the studio pretty well under control, and, if I’ve spotted a figure in another house I can re-create it fairly well at home if I pay attention to the lighting, and adjust my light accordingly. How great was the quantity of light? Did it fall onto the figure from in front, from behind, from the right, from the left, from above, from below?  The cupboard is fine too.  It was a tricky job, because the blinds were too wide for the windows and had to be altered. But it’s finished for now, and only now do I have the full enjoyment of the studio, and it almost corresponds with what I seek. Later I may get a small room in the attic as well — if there’s some old wood again.  A highly picturesque and distinctive thing could be made there. But this is a minor point.  But the studio is 10 times better. It’s going to cost me more now than I had thought, though, because so many changes had to be made to the old blinds.  I wager you can understand that the studio is utterly transformed as a result — Oh, I find it such a delight — I was driven to distraction because I couldn’t get it right. May the spring do her good. Well, old chap, I’m writing in haste and still have a lot of work to do — I’m immensely pleased with the changes to the windows. It’s effective for the time being, as far as I can tell. You must remember how the light was too harsh and couldn’t be altered when you visited this summer. From the scratch, you’ll probably be able to see that now one can vary it endlessly and reproduce effects one sees in small houses. The advantage that one then has is that whereas in those small houses one can’t stand back at the proper distance to draw the figures, one can in the studio. Adieu, with a firm handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Tonight I’ll probably even dream of chaps in sou’westers and oilskins on which the light falls and creates remarkable glancing lights that accentuate the form.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b292 V/19My dear Theo, Thanks for your letter and the enclosure. The heart that is fainting May grow full to o’erflowing And they who behold it,  Shall wonder and know not  That God at its fountains, Yet it wasn’t done just now. I began it a few months ago, and since then it has had a lick or two now and again. Has remained in a rough-hewn state, though. I’ve since done many studies, that is drawings, of figures and especially of heads too. Precisely with an eye to such scenes as this sketch depicts, in which the finishing consists of putting texture and character into the heads, hands and feet especially. So it’s not a matter of finishing them one by one — no, one has to do those 20 or 30 heads practically at once, one after the other.  So enough about this — I like watercolour enough never to abandon it completely, I mess about with it constantly.  But the basis for everything is knowledge of the figure. So that one can readily draw fellows and females and children in every possible action. I’m working mostly on that, for I don’t think one can get to what I want by another route.  As to the paint, it really is finished, and what’s more, because of one or two fairly heavy expenditures, I’m starving rather than just hard up.  I think the changes to the studio will give me a push forwards, not the first day but when I’ve fiddled about with things for a few months.  Because now, using models at home, I can study some of the effects like those in the watercolour I sent deuced well.  A lot of what you sent was immediately gone and I wish you had some more, but decide what suits you best. I have so much work now that I can vary it as I please. I long for you to come, specifically so that I can show you the studies and talk about the work. Adieu, thanks again — with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b293 V/1962 (sheet 1) and d318 V/1970 (sheet 2: sketch and postscript) Van Gogh wrote the PS on the back of the envelopMy dear Theo. As you see, when I have the figures pose there, I get them exactly as they were in the actual soup kitchen.  Of course now I can search for the poses of the figures for as long and as much and as minutely as I like, while still remaining broadly true to what I saw.  Do you know what I’ll need very badly for that? — some different pieces of fabric, brown, grey &c., to get the right background colour. In the case overleaf the wall is white with panelling painted grey, the floor darker. One can re-create the locality much more accurately by paying attention to things like that. I already have several things for it, and also have various REAL clothes. Yesterday, for example, bought a remarkably picturesque patched smock of coarse linen. I always keep an eye open for that kind of thing; if one gives it some thought one gets much more satisfaction from one’s models than if one leaves it entirely to chance.  The changes to the studio present me with more indirect costs than direct ones. For I won’t consider it finished before I have various things that I need to make it practical.  I say ‘better drawings’; that is relatively. There are some among the studies of heads — orphan men &c. that I still have here — that I won’t immediately do better, since nature is definitely in them, and something I’m not yet satisfied with, of course, but of which equally I don’t yet dare say that I’ll do it so much better tomorrow or the day after.  But by better drawings I mean something else, namely that I’ll approach them differently and try to put more chiaroscuro in them, which is something rarely if at all found in my studies of this winter.  And I now dare promise you that in any event.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b294 V/1962 (sheet 1) and d319 V/1971 (sheet My dear Theo, That watercolour became too unclear, partly due to the paper, which wasn’t right for it. But I saw how the studio is now infinitely more suitable for colour and will of course not give up after this first trial. When I have some more natural chalk, I’ll again do a few figures of orphan men with it. And you’ll get completely different compositions of soup distributions, of which this is now the first. That needn’t rule out a smaller size, and I can always reduce them. There’s much in this rough sketch that bothers me, but I know for sure that I’ll soon make progress. I wouldn’t have put it in those words myself, but I’ve sometimes felt the same.  The fact is that I plan to buy various things which he’s had for a long time and which he’ll let me have cheap, supposedly at cost price. Above all, there are some sheets of painting paper of a coarse variety that’s no longer in demand but suits me better than the smooth kind. You’d do me a huge favour with the natural chalk. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b295 V/19Dear brother, I believe that you can already see from the figures that the studio is better now as regards the light. Isn’t everything outside beautiful at the moment, don’t you agree? I have many plans — you will understand that. You know that I’m busy with lots of different things. But I’d also like so much to learn different methods, because that’s a stimulus to work hard, and one gets more ideas as a result. It’s not that I would like you to send me some more because I wouldn’t be able to work otherwise; but I’ve written about it because I’d then be able to do many things with it in addition to the normal work. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b296 V/1962 The ‘asvaalt’ – this rubbish dump is shown as ‘Aschlaat’ on an 1882 map – was in the neighbourhood of the gasworks, so just behind N.W. Binnensingel. Cf. exhib. cat. The Hague 1990, pp. 41, 17My dear Theo, If it was as cold in your part of the world as it was here last week, she wouldn’t have been best pleased. While for your part you say you sometimes long for us to be able to talk rather more about various things in art, for my part I feel that longing constantly, and on occasion very strongly. I would so often dearly like to know your opinion about this or that — about some studies &c., for example whether they might be made into something suitable, or whether it was advisable to press on with something for one purpose or another. I would like so often to have more information about matters which you certainly know more about than I do, and would dearly like to hear more about what’s going on, namely what sorts of thing are being made. This can all be dealt with in part by letter, but writing takes time and one doesn’t get round to it easily, nor can one go into things in sufficient detail. And now in particular — because studies are piling up, rather — I’d give a great deal for us to be able to speak to each other again, and I also long for you to see how much more suitable the studio now is. Anyway, we’ll hope that it won’t be so very, very long before you come to Holland. I mean, even if I were in certain fairly serious difficulties, and even if there were sombre days in my life, I wouldn’t like it and wouldn’t consider it right if someone were to count me among the unfortunate. I’m greatly privileged compared with many others, but all the same I can’t do everything that I have the heart and enthusiasm to undertake. The costs are so many, beginning with the model and food and accommodation, and ending with different paints and brushes. And that, too, is a loom where different threads must be kept apart.  Yet we all face this — but precisely because anyone who paints or draws is faced with this, and is nearly overwhelmed by it if alone, why don’t more painters join hands to work together like soldiers forming ranks? And, above all, why are those branches of art that are the least expensive so despised? What bothers me more than that line of the composition is something that you’ve also noticed, by the way — that the two figures are too equal in strength. In part this is because the natural chalk lacks some tones, and one would like to put in greater strengths with lithographic crayon, say. Nonetheless, I believe there is moreover another, weightier reason, namely that I must become much more skilled than I am if I’m to be at all content with myself. And I hope that gradually I’ll work more deftly and more elaborately in the same amount of time that I now devote to it. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b297 a-b V/1962My dear Theo, You’ve so often shown me a glimpse of Paris through your descriptions, this time I’m letting you have a look out of my window at the snow-covered yard. It wouldn’t surprise me in the least if the little I’ve sent you recently struck you as being a rather meagre result. Indeed, I believe it could hardly be otherwise. While that wouldn’t mean that the rest had been done for nothing, since studies that fail in some respects turn out one day to have a purpose and to be of use for some new composition after all. When you come you must see my woodcuts again. I’ve got some new ones since last time. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b299 a-b V/1962, d317 V/1970 and d324 V/1970  My dear Theo, Not everything, of course, there’s too much lumber for that, but the beauties from it. I can’t tell you how happy I feel because of the improvements to the studio, and how preoccupied I am once more with all manner of figures that I must do. Your description of the cab-stand and the venerable urinal and the bills stuck on it is really very good — it’s a great pity you don’t draw it. Speaking of bills, the place where they’re put up is sometimes a curious parody of the bill, or the other way round. To mention just one of many — at the entrance to the Lombard or pawnshop I saw a bill with the following words in big letters NB. As you probably know, Eigen Haard is a magazine. I thought this one rather good; if one kept an eye out for them one would find even better ones. What I’m beginning to long for very much at times is to work with several models at once. To do drawings that are slightly more complicated. But this desire isn’t pressing — after all, I have enough to do. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b298 a-b V/1962   The poster would have been an announcement of the prospectus for this illustrated family magazine ‘Hearth and Home’, which also offered ‘art plates’. On this magazine: Hemels and Vegt 1993, pp. 146-150. My dear Theo, I’ve received the natural chalk — many thanks — it’s very good — softer than what I first had from you, though, and the pieces are shorter by half. I would still like to have the harder kind in larger pieces, but I’m very pleased with this. Only I think that if I had done them in ordinary conté, something deathly or iron-like would have entered into them that would have made people say immediately: that isn’t life or nature. Through certain greys — through a certain warmth of life and pith in the black — one prevents it being deathly and iron-like. And in my view these little things make it worthwhile to go to the trouble of finding such materials as natural chalk and lithographic crayon. I’m very glad that you sent it. Anyway, when you come sooner or later, we’ll be better able to talk about it. Can you understand that it’s something I think about a great deal while at work, and that I have a great love of it? Anyway, my chief concern now is to ensure that the quality of the seed (namely the drawings themselves) improves, and if it takes a little longer I’ll be content, provided the harvest is better as a result. But I still have my eye on that harvest. Now write again soon and believe me, with a handshake, Ever yours, Vincent This afternoon I was engrossed in it for a few hours and then came into the studio — about the time the sun was setting. From the window I looked out on a broad, dark foreground — dug-over gardens and soil, mostly warm black earth, very deep in tone. Running obliquely across that is the little road of yellowish sand with green edges of grass and the thin, spindly poplars. A background of a grey silhouette of the city with the round roof of the station and towers and chimneys. And, by the way, the backs of houses still everywhere – but in the evening everything is brought together by the tone. And so, overseeing the whole, simply a foreground of black, dug-over earth, a road crossing that, a grey silhouette of a city with towers behind, just above that and almost on the horizon the red sun. The position is, though, that it’s beginning to weigh on me more and more, in the sense that I want to make my figures more beautiful. Yet more if need be — but I believe you’ll understand that the very making of them, having the models before one, thinking about them, doesn’t lead to one’s being content with the work but rather to the opposite, namely that one says, yes, the same as that but better still and more serious still. Now I wouldn’t be attached to this idea if I thought it was impracticable, but the very fact that these drawings already exist means that the desire to make them better is more a matter of actual toil on them than just an idea. And I haven’t got any further with making a final plan, since I find the execution of it more interesting. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b300 a-b V/1962My dear Theo, I’ve been working with printer’s ink lately — it’s thinned with turpentine and applied with a brush. Gives very deep tones of black. Mixed with some Chinese white, it also gives good greys. By adding more or less turpentine one can even wash very thinly with it.  We must definitely discuss this question when you come here, and I’ll show you drawings that could be done on it.  I can assure you of this: the work is going better and better with time, and I feel more warmth of life, so to speak, as a result, and I think of you constantly during it, since it’s through you that I’m able to work without fatal obstacles, namely without direct restrictions.  Where they know that there are fire, food, drink and a few quarters to be earned. At present that’s only on a very small scale, I hope it will grow.  I wish you well — write again when you have a moment. Adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b301 V/19Dear brother, Thank you for your letter and the 50 francs enclosed, which were very welcome as always, both the former and the latter. Love of one’s fellow man is something one would expect to be able to take for granted in everyone as the basis of just about everything. But some believe there are better foundations. I feel little curiosity about them. This old foundation that has been tested and found good for so many centuries is enough for me. Don’t you find this nicely put? — it’s from Les misérables: If Caesar had given me Glory and war, And if I was forced to forgo My mother’s love, To great Caesar would I say, Take back your sceptre and your chariot, I love my mother more, hey!, A woman, however good and noble she may be by nature, in my view stands in great and immediate danger in today’s society of sinking into the maelstrom of prostitution if she has no means and isn’t protected by her own family. What is more natural than that one should support such a person? At least it seems to me that one must make it a principle to continue with this protection once offered until rescue is complete, and to protect with one’s own breast if necessary. Even without a particular love? Perhaps, yes — in that case it’s a marriage of convenience, so be it — but not in the sense of a marriage that one enters into for gain. Printer’s ink has much livelier effects than indian ink. It goes without saying that I’m not in a rush to have this information, but if you happen to hear something about different methods of drawing, do let me know. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b302 V/19My dear Theo, Well, at present there are no drawings in which I don’t work in printer’s ink with a brush.  Well, adieu old chap, best wishes for your patient, good fortune with work. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b303 V/19My dear Theo, Do you realize it’s almost a year since you were here? I long so much for you to come. It’s work from that whole year that I must show you — that we must discuss in connection with the future.  One must know the structure of figures so well to get expression — at any rate that’s how I see it. I’m again longing for your letter. Adieu, old chap, with a hearty handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b304 V/1962My dear Theo, Your letter and the enclosure were most welcome, as always. And as always, thank you for them — I appreciate it all the more knowing so well that you yourself have many cares. So rest assured on this point. If I count from last May, Theo, this year hasn’t been exactly easy or free of care, eh. But that’s nothing; convenience or being without cares isn’t my ideal and goal either. Still, rather a lot has happened. Anyway, I’ve just about given up responsibility for that. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b305 V/19My dear Theo, I worked in the dunes these last few days but I long for a model, I can’t get on otherwise. In short, I’m a little worried. So write as soon as possible — apart from that, I’m making fairly good progress with the work, and I believe you would approve of some of the drawings I’m working on. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b306 V/19My dear Theo, The number of studies keeps growing — when you come I think you’ll find some to put in a portfolio in your room perhaps, anyway that’s up to you, as long as you clearly understand that you may of course regard anything you take a liking to as your own. Other things must come forth from the studies, though, and better studies come from the old ones. I myself don’t know exactly how.  But I do long for you to see them again.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b307 a-b V/1962My dear Theo, It was a truly enjoyable day — he was rather changed in both  his appearance and his manner — for my part I find him much better like this than before. He’s broader in the shoulders, and in his views on many matters as well, I believe.  Well, the money from him has helped me to get many things I needed; it was badly needed.  I had to keep back some money for a pair of trousers, though, and tomorrow there’s the cost of travelling to Utrecht. But it still helps.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b308 V/19My dear Theo, My impression was also borne out as regards certain changes for the good in his way of thinking.  I have hope we’ll become better friends from year to year, and be more and more help to each other with work. I’m seriously considering making a start on a few large charcoal drawings with figures.  My fear always is not working enough, I believe I can make it so much more beautiful, and I hunt for that with a certain fury sometimes. I would like you to bring my old studies when you come. I believe that with everything all together you could make a different choice, and when you come I would like us to pick out what you might like to have in such a way that it forms a kind of whole. I don’t know myself to what extent some studies are sufficiently finished to be suitable for being kept somewhere other than in my studio. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b309 V/1962 The letter was written on the day on which Van Gogh received the third remittance of May, thus on or about Monday, 21 May 1883.  My dear Theo, Now that I’ve begun composing again, my plan is to execute more things which I have in my mind and for which I already have studies.  And have made arrangements for that by having stretching frames &c. made, and also a big wooden frame so that I can work in the frame and enclose the drawing. I believe you may not be opposed to taking this one when it’s finished to show to the people at the illustrated magazines. And will take greater pleasure from something like this than from separate studies. I don’t know in advance, though, and we can see when you come.  But, old chap, I’m glad that I’ve been able to start work on this before you come, and we’ll be better able to talk about the future. I feel such a need to make something pleasing, something that makes one think. But it takes constant study to express what one feels and to capture the form. And although I have studies for it, I need models continually for this and for others, and progress depends on whether I have the money to take them. I have a few others in my mind, but I’m beginning to run short again. As you see, when I have a windfall, I make use of it to do something that would otherwise miscarry. So if at all possible, send something extra as well.  Adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b310 V/1962 (sheet 1) and d328 V/1969 (sheet 2)My dear Theo, Thanks for your letter and thanks for the enclosure. Today is Sunday, and this week I’ve worked furiously and am taking today off to be able to write quietly to you, at somewhat greater length than has been possible recently, because many things distracted me. And my need to write is all the greater because I see from your letter that not everything is going well for you, and I wanted to write rather more warmly than normal.  Well, you say that business isn’t flourishing. That’s bad enough. But the situation has always been precarious and always will be in life. Let’s keep our spirits up and seek energy and serenity.  Well, it’s a similar scene, but just the team of workmen labouring.  The figures are drawn from extensive studies. I would very much like them to be reproduced. The first is on grey paper, the other on yellow.  I’ve arranged everything in readiness for larger compositions and again have strainers for two new ones. I want to do the tree-felling in the woods sometime, and the rubbish dump with the rag-pickers and the potato-digging in the dunes.  But when you see these drawings, Theo, and see the studies, you’ll understand that this year I’ve had as much care and trouble as I can bear. It’s maddeningly difficult to forge the figure.  It’s disappointing that you write that business isn’t going very well — if the position gets more precarious, let’s redouble our efforts.  Now I believe that it isn’t every day that the managers of illustrated magazines find someone who regards those magazines as his special goal.  From the small sketch that I’ve made just this minute (in a quarter of an hour and enclosed herewith) of the large drawing, you can see that, if it’s a matter of making the format smaller or bigger, I’m not daunted by that. If I know definitely that this or that is required in a certain size, I can do that.  But for my own study I prefer to work in a somewhat larger size, so that I can study the hands, feet, head in more detail.  But once again, as long as I don’t find employment the money from you is absolutely indispensable. What I received from you today — I immediately have to pay out exactly as much as I receive, I still have to pay three models whom I had several times, I have to pay the carpenter, pay rent, still pay the baker and grocer and the cobbler as well, and stock up again. Well, in front of me I have two blank sheets for new compositions and must set to work on them. I ought to take a model again, day in, day out, and struggle until I’ve got it down. I’m starting work on it nonetheless, but in a few days, you understand, I’ll be absolutely broke, and then those terrible 8 long days of not being able to carry on and waiting, waiting until it’s the tenth again.  Yes, old chap, if only we could find someone who would take the drawings.  It’s so essential, I believe, that you see the studies and the large drawings, especially with a view to the financial side as well. You could take the same steps in Paris as I would take in London as regards the people at the illustrated magazines, I believe, if you could show them a couple of large drawings.  But in this case I think it would be wise not to begin before we’re as good as certain that they’ll readily accept it.  One obstacle to several things that I have in my head from the beach is that I don’t have a Scheveningen woman’s costume. You understand that I could do that kind of composition with Scheveningen figures in the spirit of the enclosed croquis. But if I draw a figure outdoors it is of course too superficial. It has to be taken up again and worked over with a model, and one needs the costumes. Well, that would be an expense which, if I could afford it, would make three, four drawings I have in my head smooth going. Yet how can I afford it? As I say, in three days everything I have now will be gone, because almost all of it has to be paid out immediately. For these two drawings I also needed various smocks, trousers, sou’wester &c. A model doesn’t always have on a fine smock that’s picturesque — one changes that and it becomes more real and more expressive. When you come you must see how those studies for the figures in the foreground of the croquis are solidly worked. I did them outdoors on a pile of sand near a florist.  Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b311 a-b V/1962 (sheets 1, 2) and d320 V/1969 (sheet My dear Theo, With a permanent relationship one finds great inner calm and is in harmony with nature in my view, whereas one goes against the eternal moral laws if one tries to evade the consequences of a relationship with a woman. And so, in my view, he who orders his life in harmony with the eternal laws of nature and of morality contributes to reform and progress, and consequently to the restoration of things that are disorientated in contemporary society. So don’t doubt the reasonableness of your act, and you can’t be too calm and cool in the face of cynical remarks by people. A permanent relationship is often a source of renewed energy and capacity for work. One loses patronage but gains in capacity for work, and holds one’s own in the end. So, take heart. And as to the financial side relating to me, be assured that everything you can possibly spare is as absolutely necessary to me as air, and my productivity depends on it.  Adieu, old chap, with a hearty handshake. Ever yours, Vincent It would be all the more desirable if you could send me something extra because I would like to do more rather than less in the coming days, in the time still to pass between now and your arrival.  I have hopes of making good progress because I’m getting some results with the lithographic crayon &c. that are stronger and better than the earlier drawings. Just a little further and I believe they’ll be able and willing to use me for illustration work of one kind or another. For, although this is seemingly humble, I’m made for such a position, I feel attracted by it and filled with strength.  And I’d have great pleasure in washing once more on torchon as well, probably before you come. For you mustn’t think that I’ve put watercolour or painting out of my mind. I certainly have it in mind, but drawing is the root of everything, and the time spent on that is actually all profit.  One can’t help having ‘visions of the future’. Even if one is convinced that nothing can be foreseen with certainty or sufficient accuracy. Yet what you wrote to me today could have a great influence on my future.  Anyway, this has made your arrival twice as important to me, and I’ll try to give myself a few tugs forwards, and help me with that if you can.  If you had a more domestic life, I believe we’d understand each other even better, and it seems to me we’d be even more help to each other.  And I understand you will probably have cares, and if there’s anything I can do to make my work better so that we can do something with it, I’ll redouble my efforts.

See De Génestet 1869, vol. 2, pp. 206-20My dear Theo, In the foreground all kinds of broken and discarded objects, bits of old baskets, a rusty street-light, broken pots &c. While making these first two drawings, so many ideas and such a strong desire to do yet more have come to me that I don’t know where to start. But finally I’ve concentrated on the dung-heap. Well, Theo, we must keep up our spirits, and see that we carry on toiling energetically.  Even if we’re anxious at times and don’t know how we’ll pull through, that is nothing and cannot be otherwise. Those who persevere often triumph.  And just now, when sending the money is beginning to be doubly hard for you, there may perhaps be a real chance to place something.  If I can get hold of the patched cape, old chap, then I’ll have my female figures for the foreground of the drawing of the rag-pickers, I’m sure of that.  And it’s a start with looking for other female figures for Scheveningen drawings too.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b312 V/1962 The letter has no ending and is not signed, so it is probably incompletMy dear Theo, So I think those words were intended more as advice or warning (advice that in the end has no solid grounds in my view, and doesn’t hold water) and less as a sign of definite resistance or opposition to your firm decision.  They may think that you haven’t yet made up your mind, or they may believe that you haven’t given it enough thought.  Cutting it short by saying something like, for example, ‘You take a rather gloomy view of the future’ and ‘can hardly demand from me that I act as if the end of the world were imminent’ is wiser in this case, I believe, than taking their words very seriously. If you want to help him, write quite lightly and cheerfully, and write about your visit this summer as though it’s certain you’ll see them again soon (even though you may not know yourself yet how you’ll fit your visit in as regards the time).  Now a word about the work. I can go into the men’s ward as a visitor. It was very real, inexpressibly real.  A small chap with a long, thin neck in a chair on rollers, among others, was priceless.  Now the wheelbarrows going up and down and the rag-pickers with dung forks, that grubbing about under the sheds, has still to be expressed without losing the effect of light and shade of the whole. On the contrary, it must be strengthened as a result. Because I myself am not one of those who don’t fail in words either — such people would be perfect — and don’t make the slightest claim to perfection.  Adieu, old chap, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b314 V/19My dear Theo, Your letter and the contents were truly welcome, many thanks for them.  And I was pleased to see that you were taking things calmly, and indeed I had expected nothing else. I mean as regards the objections raised.  On that day, it was near evening, the old boys were sitting on benches and chairs around an old cannon stove, very real.  Perhaps I’ll try that one in Voorburg now I can’t do it here.  One can’t always live outside the fatherland, and the fatherland isn’t just nature; to that must be added human hearts that seek and feel the same. It’s only then that the fatherland is complete and one feels at home.  This is now the composition of the dung-heap. I don’t know how much sense you can make of it. In the front women emptying dustbins, behind them the sheds where the dung is stored, and the fellows at work with wheelbarrows &c.  Yet that light effect really is there, since the light falls from above between the sheds onto the figures that are on the paths. Adieu, old chap, best wishes in everything and thanks for the timely dispatch. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b315 V/19My dear Theo, Had been thinking about it for a long time and recently I saw it looking so beautiful one evening and did my sketch in such a way that I’ve since changed little of what I put down then as regards the broad outlines of the composition. At the place itself I had a fellow who scrambled up the heaps and stood here and there so that I could see the proportion of the figure at various places. But I’ve since done various figure studies for it, although the figures come out small.  Just while I’m doing these studies, a plan for an even larger drawing, namely of the potato-digging, begins to take root in me. And the way I have it in my mind, you might perhaps see something in it.  The figures just about one foot high, the composition breadthways, 1 to 2.  A row of diggers, men and women, in the background. And take the perspective of the area so that in the other corner of the drawing from where the women are gathering up, I get the spot where the wheelbarrows come.  Now, apart from the figures of the kneeling women, I could already show you the other figures in large studies.  Yes, I want to start on these drawings in the next few days, I have the sites pretty well in my head, and shall seek out a fine potato field at my convenience and do studies of it for the lines of the landscape.  I saw it here last year, and the year before last at Het Heike, where it was splendid, and the year before that in the Borinage, where it was done by miners. Anyway, this is how it has ripened in my mind. The figures ought to be such that it’s true everywhere, and more than a costume study. Well, that blank canvas preoccupies me in spite of everything else, and while making studies I’m always looking for new ones to add. And it’s becoming clearer to me day by day, but it’s devilishly difficult to find figures that look right as opposites and can still find a place in the same, very confined space. And one has to do each one perhaps 3 or more times before it works out. But I’ll make a start on it and do the same as with the dung-heap, that is, begin again later on another stretching frame if the first doesn’t come out as I want. But wanted to have it relatively finished towards the time for potato digging, even though I’ll then have to go over it again completely on another piece of paper.  For my part, what I often do these days is that if I’m drawing a digger who has one leg in front of the other, or his one arm in front of the other, or his head leaning forwards, I first draw in detail the leg, the arm or the neck and back of the head that’s behind the one in front and hence out of view, and only afterwards on top of that what’s in sight, to get it as accurate as possible.  I hope I’ll succeed in getting down the shadow or the ghost of the potato drawing by the time you come. I long for you. Don’t you know anything more definite about when you’ll be coming? Well, I must get back to my coal workers. All the cash I have at the moment is a money order for 1.23  1/2  guilders which is torn in two and has already been refused once. So I don’t need to tell you that I’ll be looking forward to your letter keenly. I’ve covered the big stretching frame so that I have a distraction and can still work in the days before receipt again if perhaps I can’t get a model. But perhaps I can get one after all.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b316 V/19My dear Theo, Anyway, read the letter, it seems to me such a robust attitude to things. Send the letter back to me later. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b317 V/19My dear Theo, Yes, one can lapse into errors, into exaggerations of this or that perhaps, but one arrives at something original. I must carry on working hard, precisely because I do indeed have hope that some things will remedy themselves and come right. I did that with the English manner particularly. I didn’t find it at all beautiful immediately and first thought, exactly like most people here, that the English were in fact completely wrong, but in my case that didn’t last, and I learned to see things from another angle.  Well, I’m certainly starting to feel at home here compared with the beginning, and find what I did here in the beginning very superficial. And the very hope of expressing it more and more powerfully and elaborately means that it seems to me a good time, for now I have no lack of subjects and models (in so far as I can pay them). I’m full of ideas and plans, and so the worries haven’t overwhelmed me yet.  But one still has to pay and everything costs money, and one has to deal with obstacles which are rather like wrestling through a hedge of thorns. And it truly is the case that in fact I really ought to have more models, but I can’t take more; I do my utmost and more than my utmost, so to speak, as regards expenditure on them, but the housekeeping costs money too, and in fact I don’t really have enough. What to do? Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b318 a-b V/1962 Van Gogh noted this quotation in a poetry album for Theo in 1875. See Pabst 1988, p. 25.My dear Theo, I’ve written to you quite often lately, but it comes down to the same thing so much that I’m in fact dissatisfied that I don’t write to you more entertainingly. That will come again eventually — I think that once you’ve been to the studio again there will be livelier material. At least I hope so, and that will be the case if you’re in sympathy with what I’m working on and you haven’t yet seen.  I find him very honest and thorough, and believe that precisely when he appears to have dashed something off quickly he remains no less sound and correct in his drawing after all. He’s one of those men I don’t know personally and yet, when I see something by him, I can imagine how he did it.  Here’s a scratch of potato grubbers, but they’re slightly further apart in the drawing. I continue to be rather surprised that it hasn’t come right, all the more so because when you get down to it there’s virtually nothing about which there is a difference of view.  It’s now so long ago, in fact, that these days I’m beginning to regain my good humour as regards work, and confidence that it will be all right. I used to have that before, in spite of everything, but one can’t help being upset all the same, and feeling melancholy when such people disapprove or say that what one is doing is the wrong direction.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b319 V/19My dear Theo, Theo, when you come to the studio I’ll be able to show you some things that you’ll most certainly not be able to see all together anywhere else. I could show you some things that one might call the hundred masterpieces of modern wood engraving. Work by people whose names, even, are totally unknown to most art lovers. I already had some last year, but what I’ve found since goes far beyond my expectations. It’s agreed, isn’t it, that your visit to the studio when you come won’t be too brief? Not only I but almost all who seek their own way have something like this behind or beside them as a perpetual discourager. Sometimes one is burdened by it and feels wretched and, so to speak, overwhelmed.  It is so, however, that life sometimes becomes sombre and the future dark when working costs money and one feels oneself going ever deeper into the ground the harder one works, instead of work helping one to stay above water and one being able to overcome the difficulties and costs by making a greater effort.  I’m making progress with my figures, but financially I’m losing ground and can’t keep up.  And of late I’ve sometimes thought of moving to the country, either on the seashore or somewhere where work on the land is real. Because I believe it would save some money. I could do what I want here as well if I could earn some more — go here and there now and again to get studies. And the advantage here is that my studio is good, and one isn’t completely outside the art world, after all. In any event, one can hardly do entirely without some measure of contact, seeing and hearing something now and again.  I haven’t asked you for details about the woman recently because I’m confident that you two love each other, and that’s the main thing, and if one knows that there’s no need to ask about details.  Here I miss the necessary friction with others, and I don’t see how that will get any better. In the end, one place or another will do for me, and I prefer to move as little as possible.  Above all write the promised letter about the one hundred masterpieces &c., and should you do well in business and if a little extra is possible, it wouldn’t be untimely. As for living in the country — I find nature beautiful, and yet there are many things tying me to the city, the magazines especially, the opportunities for reproduction. I wouldn’t mind not seeing locomotives, but never seeing a printing press again would be harder to take. Adieu, old chap, with a handshake and thanks again for what you sent. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b320 a-b V/19My dear Theo. See that you send me something soon, old chap, for I need it badly.  Regards, old chap, I wish you well, and write soon. Adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b321 V/19My dear Theo, Here in The Hague there isn’t a single person I've ever done that with in the city itself; most think the city ugly and pass by all of it. And yet it’s really beautiful in the city sometimes, don’t you agree?  As for going to London sooner or later for a while, long or short, I too believe that there would be more chance of doing something with my work over there; I also think that I could learn a great deal if I could make the acquaintance of some people there. And there I wouldn’t be short of subjects to do, I assure you. There would be beautiful things to do on the wharves beside the Thames. Anyway, we must talk about various things again when you come. I hope you won’t be in too much of a hurry; we’ll have rather a lot to deal with. I’d like to be able to get some studies in Brabant again in the autumn.  Ever yours, Vincent As you see from the above illustration, painted with a not unmystical scene, probably taken from Revelation, one would imagine at first sight.  From a distance they’re areas of faded colour as on bleached and rotting and mouldering wallpaper, and in that sense there are qualities in it that are absolutely unpalatable to me. I learned a lesson today from that visit, namely that one can count oneself lucky if one is in relatively normal surroundings in today’s society, and doesn’t have to seek refuge in a coffee-house life which will make one begin to see things ever more cloudily and confusedly. For the latter is his situation, about that I have no doubt. Imperceptibly he has strayed terribly far from a calm, rational contemplation of things, and now he can’t put down a single calm, reasonable line or brushstroke as long as this stress continues.  The remedy would be to look at length at the potato leaves that are so deep and elegant in colour and tone at present, instead of driving himself mad looking at lengths of yellow satin and pieces of gilt leather.  Anyway, we’ll see how it goes. He’s intelligent enough, but it’s a kind of bias towards eccentricity that he persists in regardless. If he deviated from the normal for a reasonable motive, well and good, but here it’s a question of not taking any trouble with his work either. I find it truly wretched and I hope he recovers, but he has lost his way badly. This week I’m going to start in Scheveningen. I would have liked there to be room for a little extra, then I would have bought some painting materials.  Regards again, Theo. Best wishes.  I’m adding half a page to talk about Brabant. Among the figures of types from the people that I did there are several with a certain, what many would call old-fashioned, character, also in the approach. For example, a digger who’s more like those one sometimes finds in the bas-reliefs carved in wood on Gothic pews than a contemporary drawing. I very often think of the Brabant figures, which I find especially sympathetic. Leaving aside irrelevant differences in religious views, to me the figure of a poor village pastor is one of the most sympathetic in type and character that there is, and I wouldn’t be myself if I didn’t attack it sometime.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b322 a-c V/1962My dear Theo, I’ve sorted out my painting materials as far as was practicable, and replaced what I lacked and equipped myself with tram tickets &c. But, old chap, I would ask you to do your utmost to send me a little more, if at all possible, for I’m already broke because of one thing and another I absolutely had to have to be able to start in Scheveningen. It needn’t be very much, but just something to tide me over so that I’m not absolutely without a thing to drink in the dunes.  The photos are Sower, potato grubbers and Peat diggers; the last seemed to me to come out the best.  Don’t you think that was kind of the surveyors? They’re kind, cheerful fellows who’ve given me a lot of companionship.  When I’ve got my bearings in Scheveningen I’ll bring the woman along now and then to pose, or at least to indicate the position and size of figures.  I’ll be in no little difficulty if you absolutely cannot send anything extra. I’ve only taken what was definitely indispensable for the painting box, but have nonetheless been left with next to nothing.  Ever yours, Vincent Something I also wanted to say to you is that the figure studies for the large drawings are, in my view, much better than the drawings themselves.  It’s a question of not losing heart and not weakening. But make sure you spend a long time with me, brother.  When times are difficult we must give each other moral courage at the least, so that we don’t give up when trials come. In the company of other painters I try to appear offhand and not doubting for a moment.  If next year we can have painted studies, painted as steadily as the present ones are drawn steadily, then I think we can consider the battle won for the time being.  Until then it will be a close thing, and if we can muster some strength we’ll have to exert it to the utmost, and in no case can we have too much of it.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b323 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b1036 V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, I don’t know how you intended those words, nor can I know. Your letter is too brief, but it gave me an unexpected blow right in the chest.  But I would like to know what the position is, whether you noticed something in me, that I wasn’t making progress or something.  So now my first consignment of photos to be shown to someone or other if needed coincides with your ‘as for the future, I can give you little hope’. Is there something in particular???  Long rows of diggers — poor fellows set to work by the city — in front of a piece of dune land that’s to be dug over. But to do that is terribly difficult.  My doing depends on your doing, in the sense that if you were to reduce what you send I couldn’t go on and would be desperate.  I, too, have an enormous feeling of faintness at times in the dunes or elsewhere, because there’s nothing coming in.  Look, Theo, I just hope that you aren’t losing heart, but truly, if you’re going to talk about ‘giving no hope for the future’ then I feel sad, for you must have the courage and the energy to send, otherwise I’ll be stuck and powerless to move forward, for those who could be friends have become hostile, and appear to want to stay like that.  So you should also try to hold on to the present with respect to me, and let’s persevere with what we can persevere with, preferably today rather than tomorrow. As you know, last summer I painted — now I’ve hung up several studies again, because when I was doing new ones I saw that there was something in them after all. Painting helped me indirectly with my drawing during the winter months and the spring, and I worked that up right until these recent drawings. Now, though, I feel it would be good to paint again for a while, and I need that to become richer in tone, in the drawings too. I had planned to paint the women sitting in the grass mending the nets in a fairly large format, but after what you said I’ll wait until I’ve spoken to you.  But I can’t think of a way out, I come up against expenses on all sides. When I read the life story of one painter or another, I see that in fact they all needed money, and were miserable when they couldn’t carry on.  I had hoped that you would have been able to send something — well, in any event, especially if you have no money, you must write to me soon, for it’s quite a feat to keep one’s spirits up in the circumstances. I think the drawings from which the photos have been taken aren’t yet deep enough in tone, not yet depicting the emotion nature evokes sufficiently, but if you compare this with what I began with, the earlier figures, I believe I’m not mistaken in seeing signs of progress and we mustn’t let go of that advance, so let us toil on.  I wish you could come. Write soon in any case. Adieu, with a handshake.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b324 a-c V/1962  Sunday evening. Dear brother, There’s nothing wrong, or is there? If there is something, say frankly what kind of obstacles are in the offing. Write in any case, if possible by return of post, and say whether or not there is something. I can’t help it if it has no cause, but I’ve suddenly fallen ill; it may be a reaction to my having over-exerted myself.  Ever yours, Vincent I don’t really have any friends except for you, and when I’m ill you’re always in my thoughts. I wish you were here and we could confer again about a move to the country.  Apart from what I’ve already written, there’s nothing particular wrong with me and things carry on as normal — but I may have caught a chronic fever or something, and have suddenly fallen ill. I’ve had to pay out left and right again: landlord, paint, baker, grocer, cobbler, I don’t know what else, and what’s left isn’t much. Anyway, the worst thing is that after many weeks like that one sometimes feels the strength to bear things diminishing, and begins to feel a general fatigue.  Even if you have nothing to send immediately, brother, make sure in any event that you write to me, if you can, by return of post. And as for that future, if there’s something wrong, don’t be afraid to say so, forewarned is forearmed, it’s better to know exactly what one will be fighting against.  I did do some work today, but I was overcome all at once by a malaise in my very marrow, and I don’t exactly know what to attribute it to.  Otherwise I cannot say — cannot understand — why the work shouldn’t be making progress.  I’ve set my whole heart on it, and that seemed to me a mistake, at least for the moment.  All things considered, what it will come down to is that we continue to understand each other well and keep our friendship warm. Then if misfortune comes, we’ll defy it but, brother, let’s remain true to each other.  I gain everything, for without you I wouldn’t have been able to carry on to where we are now; you gain nothing except for the feeling of giving a career to someone who would have had no career otherwise.  And later, who knows what we can produce together in this way? A period of some struggling on will be required to get the painting right, but when you see the studies I believe you’ll see that it isn’t foolishness.  I would see less of a problem in the future if I were less awkward in dealing with people. Finding buyers if I’m without you is impossible, so to speak, and with you it’s gradually becoming possible. And if we do our absolute best it will stay on its feet and not founder, but we must stay together.  This year I had a battle to carry on in the studio; sometimes it was terribly difficult to go on working. And I must renew my strength.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b325 a-b V/19Dear brother, I’ve had an anxious and uneasy feeling since writing to you yesterday, and last night it kept me awake.  Look, imagining how I would have to work in fits and starts is a ghastly prospect for me. No one can work without money, and it seems to me advisable to work with as little as possible, yet anyone would feel weighed down and melancholy at the thought of stopping or going short of what one absolutely needs. Oh Theo, the work involves trouble and setbacks, but what is that compared with the misery that looms if someone leads a life without activity?  So don’t lose courage, and we must try to make each other’s heart strong instead of weak or upset.  What I wrote to you about (and about which you also wrote, our thoughts have crossed again), the meagreness or what they call the dryness is what must be overcome each day anew, and mustn’t become a chronic defect.  It seems to me that one thing and another wouldn’t be so bad if it weren’t for that defect. For my part I’ve constantly felt it myself while doing drawings, and thought about it a great deal, and I wrote to you about it precisely because it was urgent. I’ve thought about causes and ways of overcoming it, and see no other way than to revive my capacity for work, and also to work a little on my constitution, since it’s taking a turn that isn’t for the best. I absolutely must have some money, and must restore both my constitution and my painting box, otherwise I fear that things will crop up later that will be more difficult to put right. This is the beginning — the most recent drawings are less dry here and there than earlier ones. Now I don’t consider myself as clever in my drawings as those fellows; all the same, without being compelled by any particular course, I gave myself the task of studying the figure with perseverance for the sake of raising the level of my drawing. And precisely because of that effort, because of that over-exertion, I ended up in that dryness.  There’s no question of resting, but I believe that finding a diversion by changing the manner of work and the subjects would be a good thing.  After the figure studies I feel a need to look at length at things like the sea, the bronze potato leaves, stubble fields or ploughed earth.  So as to gain time I haven’t spared myself, I’ve stinted myself of everything as long as I could carry on working, but now I can get little more out of myself, can’t draw any more on my own basic needs, on that side there’s nothing more to be squeezed out, there is leanness and dryness.  Consider whether it’s understandable that I have grave doubts when I imagine the income being reduced while we’re already beginning to be in need.  I wish you could come soon.  Ever yours, Vincent When you read this letter, in connection with the photos sent, I believe you’ll see that I myself see the weak side of the drawings and see ways of counteracting that weakness, and certainly don’t refuse to work to overcome it, but am also faced by the question of how to obtain what I would need for that. I don’t regard the fact that I don’t have it as being your fault, though, but it isn’t mine either, and what to do — what to do? Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b326 V/19My dear Theo, Coming home from Scheveningen just now, I found your letter, for which many thanks.  But the subdivision of my 150 francs among 4 living beings, while all the expenses for models, drawing materials, painting requisites and rent must be paid from them, also makes one think, don’t you agree? I started things but as soon as the month ended I had to bend over backwards for weeks to pay the bill, sometimes almost unbearably hard up. So I wasn’t always able to do what I wanted and want to do in my heart.  Still, not disheartened, we must hammer away at it again. What I had just started on, which is actually more pressing than anything else, is painting figure studies, but I’m baffled as to how to pay for it.  I had the studio altered as well. The position is that I myself have long lived on hope.  But you’re coming soon — that’s a good thing — at any rate you’ll then see what I still have here — and will see that I haven’t been idle.  My health doesn’t suffer (fundamentally or chronically) due to excesses, but due to a long period of too little or too insubstantial food.  You must see to it that you come soon, brother, for I don’t know how long I can keep it up. Things are a little too much for me, I feel that I’m giving way under them.  I tell you frankly that I’m beginning to fear I shan’t get through in this way, for my constitution would be good enough if I hadn’t had to fast for a long time, but again and again it was a question of either fasting or working less, and as far as possible I chose the first, so that now I’m too weak. How to endure that? I see the effects so clearly and distinctly in my work that I get worried about how to move forwards. Given my present circumstances my work can’t be other than it is. If I can overcome my physical weakness, we’ll try to make progress; I’ve already postponed and postponed getting my strength back because I have to take care of others and of the work. But now I’m at my wits’ end. Progress in the work isn’t to be expected before I’m stronger; it has become all too clear to me of late that my physical condition has an influence on it.  I assure you that it’s NOTHING other than a weakening due to exertion and poor nourishment. Some who have talked about me on occasion as if I had some kind of complaint would start all over again, and that is gossip that’s very ugly, and so keep it to yourself without saying anything about it when you come here. But the dryness in the work is largely beyond my control, and will change if I can get back on my feet.  What I long for most is your coming, and for us to go through the work together and see each other again.  Regards, and in the meantime see that you write more often now and again, for I have need of it. And thanks for this last letter, mind — I wish you the very best.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b327 V/1962 The letter is not signed, so it may be incompletMy dear Theo, The incident this morning is a sign to me that it’s a duty to confer and to take a smaller place in a village if there’s no hope of being a little better off here. Otherwise, the studio here is practical enough, and there’s no lack of beautiful subjects to do here. And it isn’t everywhere that one has the sea.  What I said to you about not feeling strong is true, it has now come down to pain between the shoulders and in the lumbar vertebra, which I’ve had before from time to time, but I know from experience that one must then be careful, otherwise one gets too weak and can’t easily recover.  They have indeed left me in peace since, for months now. And other people here in the street aren’t paying either.  There’s no lack of work.  I believe, Theo, that I too could do something like that through carrying on working regularly and calmly in the future.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b328 V/1962 Planned visit by Theo (361)My dear Theo, What you write in your letter about the conflict one can have over the question of whether one is accountable for the unfortunate consequences of a good deed — whether one wouldn’t do better to act in a way which one knows isn’t good but which will allow one to come out of it without mishaps — that conflict is familiar to me too.  If one follows one’s conscience — for me conscience is the very highest form of reason — the reason within the reason — one is tempted to think one has acted wrongly or foolishly, one gets particularly upset if more superficial people are amused by thinking they’re so much wiser and are so much better at getting where they want. Yes, then it’s sometimes difficult, and if conditions are such that the difficulties rise to a spring flood, one can be led to regret that one is as one is and wish one had been less conscientious. I hope that you don’t picture me in any other way than as constantly waging the same inner battle, and also often having tired brains, and in many cases also being unable to decide questions of whether it would be better or worse to do this or that.  While I’m working I feel an unlimited confidence in art and that I’ll succeed, but on days of physical exhaustion or when there are financial obstacles I feel that faith less and am overcome by doubt, which I try to get over by immediately setting to work.  When I’m at home he can’t be kept away from me; if I’m working he comes up to tug at my jacket or works his way up my leg until I take him on my lap. In the studio he crows at everything, sits playing silently with a piece of paper for hours, a bit of string or an old brush. He’s a child who is almost always cheerful; if he manages to keep that up all his life he’ll be cleverer than I am.  So one may not be regarded as of any significance by either one side or the other, and be accounted one of the mediocrities, and feel oneself at heart to be nothing other than an ordinary person among ordinary people, yet despite all that one will arrive at a relatively fixed serenity in the end.  One will be able to raise one’s conscience to a level of development such that it will become the voice of a better and higher I that is the master of the ordinary I. And one won’t relapse into scepticism or cynicism, not become one of the vile mockers.  But I mustn’t lapse into the abstract too much. My plan is first of all to regain my strength, and I think that when that’s once more above the low-water mark I’ll get new ideas to steer my way of working in a different direction from that dry one. I hope the note is changed. I’m hugely glad you managed to send something, for I believe it spared me an illness. I’ll let you know what happens with the note. And it would be good if you could send on the first of Aug. I believe it’s still always possible that on looking through the work we may decide on another plan for the future — I don’t know what as yet — but somewhere there must be work that has to be done and that I can do as well as someone else. If London were a little closer, I for one wouldn’t leave it to others. Be assured as ever that it would give me enormous pleasure if we could make an article that would find buyers. I would then feel less conflict about the money from you that you could really do with yourself. Thanks again, and regards. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b329 V/1962 Planned visit by Theo (36My dear Theo. I don’t know whether you’re familiar with those parts, I for one had never been there before. See, this is a scratch of the path to the sea.  Scheveningen is undoubtedly very beautiful but nature there has long ceased to be virgin — well, I found the virginity of nature to be outstanding on the walk I told you about.  This is something like that mole. Then the landscape, mostly very simple flat planes: areas of weather-beaten dune land just slightly undulating. When, since our recent letters, I reflect less on the future than on the more or less present, I still have hopes that when you come we’ll take the decision that I should do a number of small watercolours for you just to try it out, and perhaps smaller paintings.  If only we can achieve enough leeway for me to be able to carry on painting continuously this year. For the rest, I’m not yet exactly back to normal. It may be that my stomach is somewhat weakened, which is what I conclude from the symptom of dizzy spells in the head, etc., which are sufficiently troublesome to make doing something about them an urgent matter. But enough of this. I’ve never had anything for teaching the son, but the father has often expressed his readiness to help. I took him up on this and said the following to him. That I had no doubt that there must be a fair number of tubes in his stock that were no longer in demand. We can discuss this again when you come. Naturally, I needn’t take or pay for the 300 tubes all at once, but in as many instalments as I wish — monthly, for example. But I’m glad of it, because 33 1/3 % will make quite a difference, especially in the long run. I’ll be glad when you come, because I think it will be good for a lot of things.  It would be good if you could send towards 1 Aug. At all events I’m glad that I’ll have some painted studies as well when you come. I have a model — a country lad — who lives here in the neighbourhood and to whom I’ve already spoken about painting studies. He can arrange to go off into the country with me, for instance into the dunes, very early in the morning. Adieu, best wishes in everything, and regards. Believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b330 a-b V/1962 Planned visit by Theo (36My dear Theo, As a result I’ve been able to keep the most worrying things within bounds, although not everything, because a lot went off straightaway for paint that I’d had in the meantime.  But in fact the figure calls to me again, and so strongly that I try to do what circumstances to some extent permit.  If I could press ahead resolutely, the autumn wouldn’t pass without the potato grubbers being done.  I don’t know to what extent the studies I’m painting from the drawings will be satisfactory in the circumstances, but all the same I’ll see to it that I make something of them.  It isn’t very easy to get models at present, because there’s plenty of work in the fields, and I wish I could spend a little more, because that would overcome the problem. Anyway I shall — it’s absolutely impossible for me at present — but as soon as I can spare it I’ll see to it that I have a couple of chaps out in the dunes for a whole day for the potato grubbers.  That would be the most direct route, and I’ll do my best.  I hope to paint one or two things in the days to come between now and your arrival. But you’ll understand that the work is rather important, and precisely because I’ve already done a lot to it I couldn’t let it go. You’ll see when you come that the thing is for us to carry on resolutely. You rightly say that what I wrote to you about financial matters is worrying, but on the other hand we can’t be far from making a thing or two that can be sold, even if for relatively little. The work is becoming much clearer to me. And when I think about it, it’s only a question of accelerating or delaying, and later we’ll even catch up, even with the past, but it’s a devilishly thorny, difficult, anxious age we’re in, all the same. If it was possible for me to get enough to have sufficient paint and models this season, I believe there would be a brightening up, and a big one at that. Well, in any case, it’s very good that you’re coming soon.  If it’s at all possible, I’ll do a few studies for it in the dunes before you come, namely going with a model to those fields behind Loosduinen, in the early morning or in the evening towards dusk. I believe that could be something. The composition of the drawing would have to be altered a little, and the effect in particular given more study, but I would keep it roughly as it is. I believe the figures should be forceful and all the rest in a lilac-like grey haze. I find the division into darker and lighter areas in the drawing not simple enough, the figures being partly light and partly dark, and the ground too. Either the ground and the figures must be brought closer to each other and form a dark silhouette against a light sky — or sky and ground must form more of a grey, misty whole against which the more toned areas of the figures stand out.  Both these effects exist, but that of the drawing isn’t right as it is now, for it’s too dry and too meagre. And because the figures have too many tones in common with the ground, they don’t stand out and the sky doesn’t belong to it. In short, the tone must be completely different but the composition can stay, more or less. It gives me a certain calm to think that we’ll see each other soon, and together look at how to continue with the work.  Well, in the coming days I’ll live on the hope of your coming. If I manage to have some success with painting, times may become a little easier.  The fortnight between now and when you come won’t, however, be very easy to get through. If possible, remember what I asked you about receiving a little more a few days before the tenth, because then I could try to do those figure studies in the dunes before you come. Adieu, and thank you again for your letter, and wishing you good fortune in every respect. And believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b331 a-b V/1962  My dear Theo, Pending your arrival there’s hardly a moment that I’m not with you in my thoughts.  These days I’m doing my best to paint some different studies so that you can see something of them at the same time.  And, moreover, I have definite hopes of making considerable progress with colour in this way. It seems to me that the latest painted studies are more assured and sounder in colour.  Otherwise things are so wretched that I still feel faint if I’m not actually at work, but I believe that is passing. I’m definitely going to do my best to build up a reserve of strength, because I’ll need it if I want to do a lot of painting, including figures. A certain feeling for colour has been aroused in me of late when painting, stronger than and different from what I’ve felt before.  I’m curious as to how this will continue and where it will lead. It has sometimes surprised me that I’m not more of a colourist, because my temperament would certainly lead one to expect that, and yet up to now that has hardly developed at all.  For example, the two studies that I did while it was raining, a muddy road with a small figure. It seems to me that it’s the opposite of some other studies — when I look at it I recognize the mood of that sad, rainy day, and in the figure, though no more than a few patches, there’s a kind of life that isn’t due to accuracy of drawing, for it isn’t drawn, so to speak. What I want to say is that I therefore believe that in those studies, for instance, there’s something of that mysteriousness that one gets by looking at nature as if through the eyelashes, so that the forms simplify themselves into patches of colour.  Time will tell, but for the present I see something different in the colour and the tone in several studies.  Anyway, I hope we’ll soon be able to talk about it and confer together. If you can, write again soon and, of course, the earlier you can send, the more I would welcome it.  With a handshake in thought. Ever yours, Vincent For no particular reason I can’t help adding something here that’s just a recurring thought of mine. Not only did I start drawing relatively late, but on top of that I can’t count on living for a great many years, relatively speaking. When I think about that cool-headedly and calculatedly — as if estimating or measuring something — then it’s in the nature of things that I can’t possibly know anything definite about it. Yet through comparisons with various people with whose life one is familiar, or in comparison with whom one believes one sees certain correspondences, one can nonetheless put forward certain propositions that aren’t absolutely without foundation.  I see myself in a similar way — as having to do something with heart and love in it within a few years, and do it with willpower. If I live longer, so much the better, but I’m not thinking about that. In those few years SOMETHING MUST BE DONE — that thought is my guiding principle in making plans for the work. A certain desire to make every effort will thus seem to you all the more understandable. At the same time a certain resolve to use simple means. And perhaps you’ll also be able to understand that, for my part, I don’t view my studies in isolation, but always have in mind the work as a whole. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b332 a-b V/19My dear Theo, The news that you’re already on the way by now gave me great pleasure. Thanks for your letter and the enclosure.  I don’t need to tell you that I’m eagerly looking forward to seeing you — I’ve been far from well in the last few days — always the same thing — heart palpitations as well at times — in the end, with me it may come down to the heart being affected. Well, I don’t know all about it in detail, but I do know that you mustn’t mention it at home or to anyone else for fear of it being misconstrued in their ideas of my circumstances.  By which I mean only that I want to do something good, come what may, and there’s a chance of bringing that about if we keep our serenity, dark future or no dark future.  That’s the area in which I propose to do studies for the potato grubbers. Adieu, old chap, goodbye for now, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b333 V/1962 The letter was sent with a letter to his parents, whom Theo was visiting. Vincent sealed the letter and wrote on the outside: ‘Monsieur Th. van Gogh JnrMy dear Theo, Ever yours, Vincent Look closely at the fields in Brabant, what they’re doing there. And try to take a look at the interior of a weaver’s cottage in the village to see whether they aren’t beautiful things. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b334 V/1962 Date of postmark: Tuesday, 14 August 188Dear brother. I wish you could understand that I must be consistent in various things.  A single point determines the steeper or gentler incline, the way the sides of the objects develop more to the right or to the left throughout the whole composition.  Well, there’s something similar in life.  When I say I’m a poor painter and still face years of struggle — in my daily life I have to arrange things more or less as a farm labourer or factory worker does — then that’s a fixed point from which many things follow, which are thus taken out of their context if they’re viewed other than in general. There are painters in other circumstances who can and must act differently. Everyone must decide for himself.  Yet it’s difficult for me to speak about those otherwise simple, ordinary matters, because they’re unfortunately connected to much deeper things.  When I say to you, I choose my duty, you know all about it. The few words about it that we exchanged on the road made me feel that nothing has changed in me in this regard, that it is and will remain a wound which I live above but which is there deep down and cannot heal — years from now it will be what it was the first day.  Regards — safe journey — write soon — but you understand how I will approach the future, with serenity and without one sign in my face betraying the struggle in the deepest depths. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b336 V/19Dear brother, I fear I’ve said something to you about the work that I ought to have put differently, and have a vague feeling that I must have bothered you with something, because there seemed to be something the matter when you left.  I hope this will resolve itself. You mustn’t rush me if you truly want to make this clear to me. This year I’ve been completely outside any kind of social circle, so to speak.  And in truth haven’t bothered about clothes.  If that’s all, it won’t be so difficult to change, will it?, especially now that I have the new suit from you. But I sincerely wish that people would forgive me such failings rather than talk about them.  If only I had got a bit further so that it would be easier to sell, I would definitely say, you be the man who takes care of business, I don’t want to have anything to do with selling, and live entirely outside those circles. Dear brother, don’t think of me as being anything other than an ordinary painter facing ordinary problems, and don’t imagine there’s anything unusual when there are hard times. I mean, don’t picture the future either black or brightly lit; you’ll do better to go on believing in grey.  Which I also try to do, and I consider it a fault if I deviate from that.  Regards, and Ever yours, Vincent And as for how I think about selling, I wanted to say this again. I believe that the best would be if we carry on working until, instead of having to praise or explain it to art lovers or say something to go with it, they feel drawn to it of their own accord. At any rate, if it’s refused or doesn’t please, one must remain dignified and calm as far as possible. I fear that my efforts when I present myself do more harm than good, and I wish I could be spared that.  So let’s simply allow nature to develop: you will become what you become, I too shan’t stay exactly as I am now. Let us not suspect each other of absurd things and we’ll continue to get by. And let us reflect that we’ve known each other from childhood, and that thousands of other things can bring us ever closer.  I’m a little concerned about what seems to be bothering you, and doubt whether I know exactly what the trouble is. Or rather, I believe the cause lies not so much in a particular, specific matter as in the realization that there are points on which our characters diverge, and that one of us understands one thing better and the other something else. I believe that this is desirable, if you and I try to remain in agreement. It’s the same with other things, which I don’t want to drag up now, although I later remember what I say, even in nervousness, and a grain of it may be right, yet not all beginnings have a continuation, and in nervous tension they often seem more than they are.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b335 a-c V/1962My dear Theo, I’m unable to decide yet. It’s a deep compassion that is so strong that everything else gives way to it, and I can no more do otherwise now than I could last year in the hospital, and I say now as then, as long as I have a crust of bread and a place to live you have a home there. It wasn’t passion then, nor is it passion now, it’s understanding each other’s needs as convincing facts. As to the work, I don’t doubt that there are things wrong with it, but I also don’t doubt that I shan’t lose my way completely, and that I’ll arrive at something good, albeit after much searching. And I believe that it’s dangerous to try to progress through something other than what is directly work.  Adieu, old chap, and, if you will, write me one more letter while you’re in Nuenen. Ever yours, Vincent I hope you see a few more beautiful sunsets above the quiet land, old chap, far away from the city, before you go back to the city. As to changing where I live, I know that this can be done at more than one place.  But of course we do what we do calmly and so we’ll write about it again. Adieu — I wish you pleasant days, and assure you that whatever the future may bring, I continue to hope that later days will be calmer.  Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b337 a-b V/19My dear Theo, You’ll understand that I’m rather eager to hear from you whether you’ve read my letter. As for myself, the course that’s the cheapest by our calculations — I believe a village would be the answer — would seem to me the most sensible in the given circumstances. If the 150 francs a month can continue, I believe we can cover the cost completely, or nearly so. Dear brother, you see that it doesn’t look as if there’ll be any leeway for me, in any event. I’ll try not to complain, and swallow what I can swallow. I remain convinced that actually more is required for the work, and that I ought to be able to spend a little more on food and other needs, but if I must manage with less — after all, my life may not be worth the food — why should I make a fuss about it? And it isn’t anyone’s direct fault, not mine either. My view as regards earning money is as simple as can be; it is that it must come through the work, and that in the circumstances I gain nothing by speaking to people about it personally. It wouldn’t agitate me if it was you, say, who know me and to whom I’m used to speaking. I tell you, I feel less energetic outdoors when I’ve been among people. If we don’t waste time with steps of that kind, we’ll make progress slowly but surely, and I know of no better way. In no case shall I refuse a serious commission, whatever is asked for, to my liking or not, I’ll try to do it as required, or do it again if required. This affects everyone and everything. At the moment you’re in Nuenen. Ever yours, Vincent As regards my work all my ideas are so ordered, so definite, that I believe you’d do well to accept what I say: let me get on with it as I am; my drawings will become good if we stay on the normal footing with each other, but because the improvement depends a little on the money for my outgoings and expenses — and not only on my efforts — be as generous as you can with the money, and if you see a chance to add any help from another quarter, don’t let it slip. But in fact these few lines contain everything I have to say. If it had been dealt with differently, if they’d said: we don’t understand how you acted in this or that case, explain it, it would have turned out differently.  I already told you, brother, discretion isn’t always understood. Too bad, perhaps. It’s better I have the career I have now, I believe, but when I left Goupil there were motives other than clothes, on my side at any rate. There was a half or whole plan then for me to get a position in paintings at the new branch in London, which in the first place I didn’t consider myself suitable for, and in the second had no interest in. I would have liked to stay with the firm if I’d been given a position that consisted less exclusively of talking to the customers. They didn’t ask me anything, though, just told me, ‘You are an honest and hard-working employee but you set a bad example to the others’, and I said nothing to refute that because I didn’t want to influence whether or not I would stay. Well — to you — I say what I don’t doubt is right to say now, given that my profession is my profession and I don’t doubt that I should stay in it. So I say this to you: not only do I wish to keep things between us as they are, but I’m really so grateful for our relationship that I only enquire about poorer or richer, more or less difficult, taking nothing for granted, that I’m content with all conditions and will fit in, adapt, make do if need be. But I desire only that you shouldn’t doubt me with respect to good will, application — and grant me a little common sense so that you don’t suspect me of doing silly things, and so quietly let me carry on working in my normal way. Of course I must seek in order to find, and not everything will come off by a long way, but in the end the work will be good. Now I mention Risler aîné again (I believe you know the book, if not read it sometime, and what I mean will be clear to you) and point out to you how that man’s appearance was more or less like mine, how his life was working in the attic of the factory on his designs and machines, how he had no time for or interest in anything else for that matter, and his greatest luxury for himself was to drink a glass of beer with an old acquaintance. A few friends I’ll have later will, believe me, take me as I am. I think you’ll understand this letter, and understand that it isn’t a case of me getting angry when something is said to me about clothes. No, inside I’m becoming ever more calm and concentrated, and something very different would be needed to make me angry. Wherever I went, I would be roughly the same — perhaps really making a bad impression everywhere in the beginning. But I doubt whether that would remain for ever with the people I talked to about it face to face. Well, from this moment on I’m again completely absorbed in the work. Do for me what can be done, think yourself about what could be useful or help us to get somewhere more quickly. I don’t doubt your good will or friendship. Regards, enjoy your days, and write soon. Adieu. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b338 a-b V/1962 His business partner is Georges Fromont (Fromont jeune), who is young and elegant, but weak in character. He has an affair with Risler’s wife, the cunning Sidonie, who fritters away the money from the factoryDear brother, I’ll write you a letter in the next few days which I’ll write at my leisure, and I’ll do my best to write briefly and still say what I believe is necessary. Anyway, more about this later. We’d be faced with the costs of moving and the travel costs.  Once there, I believe I would stay for good in the heathland and the peat districts, where more and more painters are coming, and in time a kind of painters’ colony might develop. On the boundary a lake — the black lake — a name that gives pause for thought — I imagine various dredging workers on the banks.  We’d be faced by immediate expenditure, but in the end I believe we’d gain a great deal by it. More than that, I consider it important that I’d be in a region that’s sure to be very stimulating and sure to incline one naturally towards everything serious, and my work can only be improved by it.  One would have to be prepared, though, to stay at the inn for a few days, which costs around 1 guilder per person per day. Here the rent above all, and moreover the cost of everything, is nerve-racking. And the heaviest expense, the cost of models, would most certainly be different over there in the sense that for the same amount I could get more and better models or the same number for less money.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b339 V/19My dear Theo, Ever yours,  Vincent It will be the same with the painted studies as with the drawn ones. Later, when I’ve found more, it will be seen that there’s already a certain personal character in this figure or that fragment of landscape. Anyway, if everything goes according to plan I hope to be sending you studies from Drenthe this autumn.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b340 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Ah, brother, you see that we wouldn’t have parted if we didn’t have to. I repeat, we wouldn’t have parted if we didn’t have to. Haven’t we forgiven each other’s faults time after time and made up again? We know each other so well that we can’t think each other bad. I don’t know whether it’s love, but what there is between us is between us. I come back now to Drenthe. Think about whether you see a way for me to get money to go there on my own. If need be, I imagine, I can leave the furniture here, and rent a corner of an attic somewhere from my landlord. And then I must paint a lot and be able to spend a little more on painting materials. I said to him, write to me about what I send you, and then I’ll continue in the genre that you think you can do something with. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b341 V/19My dear Theo, You write about your walk to Ville-d’Avray that Sunday, at the same time on that same day I was also walking alone, and I want to tell you something about that walk, since then our thoughts probably crossed again in some degree. Well, I came to Voorburg, and went from there to Leidschendam.  Oh, there must be a little bit of air, a little bit of happiness, but chiefly to let the form be felt, to make the lines of the silhouette speak. But let the whole be sombre.  That is also possible, precisely because it was and still is something different from a passion. I hope the Drenthe plan goes ahead. You ask what I might need. Your letter pleased me greatly, for I see that you think that there’s something in the Drenthe plan, and that’s enough for me; later on it will become clear of itself what benefit there is to be gained. But for me it’s already linked directly to becoming a member of the Drawing Society and also to England — because I know for sure that the subjects from over there will be sympathetically received in England if I’m able to put some sentiment into them. Write to me again soon, and regards. Ever yours, Vincent I have hopes that the past year will turn out to have been solid, for I haven’t neglected my work and, on the contrary, I’ve strengthened a number of weak points. There are more that need strengthening, of course, but it’s their turn now. I’ll keep on doing that and carry on with advertisements as long as necessary, and in short all the things whereby I can be of use or assistance. Write to me again soon, won’t you? Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b342 V/1962 and b343 b V/19My dear Theo, I couldn’t yet go into detail about my plans in my last letter, but now I can in some respects. Having taken the decision, I wanted to go ahead with my travel plans without delay.  The first measure to be taken was to give notice to the landlord — that has now been done.  You will ask, do I have plans to come back to The Hague then? No.  And so — though certainly not for the time being — after a period of 1 year, say, there will probably be a reason for being here for a brief or a longer stay. And through this arrangement regarding my things I stay in touch with someone who knows me and so can at any rate find me a place to live, if I ask.  So I’m a free man without encumbrances, I can leave when I like.  And I can now do more with the 150 francs from you than when so much had to come out of it. And because I have some relief from worries that were nerve-racking. The travel costs are made much simpler in this way. Well, some packing cases would be needed, which I would have to buy, and that’s another expense.  I would first like to have a look at Katwijk, to do some sea studies, and because that at any rate is within reach, even if the journey to Drenthe has to wait a while on account of the money.  I need to work and I also need you to write soon. Adieu, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b343 a V/19My dear Theo, I’ve got so far with packing &c. that I’ll leave as soon as I have the travel money. It’s best in the circumstances that I set to work straightaway. For during the removals &c. one can’t do anything good in the way of work, and I shan’t get back into my stride until I’m somewhere in the country. So I hope to be able to get away if you send something towards the 10th, if I can’t go straight through I’ll stay in a village close by for a day or two if need be.  In recent days I again saw clearly how looking at the advertisements was done merely for the sake of appearances, and that they’re probably waiting for my departure before embarking on something they don’t discuss with me.  This plan, which is again a twisting of what they began a few days ago, will almost certainly lead to nothing but wretchedness.  But I would have to be mad to help when they’re not being open with me, wouldn’t I? So I intend simply to leave and to let fourteen days or so go by. Then I’ll write to them and see how things are.  But these are so much questions of inner conflict, and hearts shrink more in pain because of them than appears. Do your best towards the tenth to send me enough for me to be able to leave if need be, because this would be wise.  All the same, don’t put yourself in difficulties for I’ll act according to the circumstances and write to you straightaway to say what I’ve done.  If it’s too little for Drenthe I’ll go to Loosduinen for a day or so and wait there. I’ve found splendid things in Loosduinen, old farmhouses, and the effects in the evening are superb there. In that case I would probably send my things ahead or put them in storage.  But it’s also just the moment at which I can conveniently end the tenancy, and when your letter comes I’ll leave here. Adieu, Theo, I wish things were already sorted out, for days like these are difficult and little good to anyone. I wish you well and good fortune, believe me Ever yours, Vincent I hope you haven’t fallen ill, I also had diarrhoea a while ago but it stopped. Eggs may be the best thing for strengthening the stomach, at least if weakness is the cause.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b344 V/19My dear Theo, I’ve just received your letter and the 100 francs enclosed. And I leave tomorrow for Hoogeveen in Drenthe. Then on from there, and from there I’ll give you an address.  I shan’t go on moaning, though, for I must press on nonetheless.  So I’m very glad that I can make progress, for in this way we help ourselves; over there I reckon 50 francs for board and lodging and the rest on the work, and that’s a big difference from what I was able to do here in the circumstances. So even if others won’t help, we won’t be idle.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b345 V/19Hoogeveen, Tuesday evening. My dear Theo, I’ve just arrived here. Anyway, am sitting in a large taproom like the ones in Brabant, where a woman is sitting peeling potatoes, quite an interesting little figure. I’ve been talking to people here, and in a day or two I’ll take the barge and travel all the way down the Hoogeveense Vaart through the peat bogs, right across the south-east corner of Drenthe. Then, northwards from here it seems that there’s magnificent heathland all the way to Assen. I’m certainly curious, as you can imagine. I hope to await your next letter here, this is a country lodging-house near the station. After that, though, I may go deeper into the countryside, but I’ll wait until I have a little stock of paint. Well, more soon; at the moment I haven’t seen anything apart from what I’ve told you, the fields out of the train window and the taproom here, which is nothing out of the ordinary. In any case I wanted to let you know that I’m here. Regards, I’ll set out tomorrow. With a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent At the lodgings here I saw a barn that’s laid out differently from the ones in Brabant. I may make something of it later, if I stay here, at least. Well, the fields around here are mostly meadowland, with small trees here and there. I think I’ve done well in making Hoogeveen my base. I’ll write soon to tell you a lot more about it than today. I’ll set out on this journey as soon as I have some more paint, and will go from one hamlet or village to another. In the village harbour I saw really authentic peat barges and the figures of bargemen. Women wearing the local costume in the hayfield — fine. It will probably be even more beautiful deeper into the countryside, but meanwhile I’m already seeing very good things — even here. So write a few words soon. As I said, to the address The village or town here is mainly one long row of houses by the harbour, many new houses and a few more beautiful old ones.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b346 V/19My dear Theo, Now that I’ve been here for a few days and have walked around a good deal in different directions, I can tell you more about the region I’ve fetched up in. Happily, the men here wear breeches; it shows off the shape of the leg, makes the movements more expressive. The heathland is rich. I saw sheepfolds and shepherds that were more attractive than those in Brabant. Beehives, too, in many places. If you follow them, you see here and there a curious old mill, farmhouse, shipyard or lock. And always the peat barges coming and going. The woman, who heard something on the roof, shot outside and threw her broom at the said goat, which leapt down like a chamois. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b347 V/19Dear Theo, However, there’s an entrance — a short avenue and then one comes upon a number of graves overgrown with bent-grass and heather. Many of them marked with white posts bearing the names. I hope to be able to send you studies from here before too long, when I’ve got a few together. And give it some thought, perhaps some of them might be something for Wisselingh. Ever yours, Vincent You know the address is A. Hartsuiker lodging-house keeper Hoogeveen. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b348 a-b V/19Dear brother, I hope to be able to visit him there myself this winter and to make a few more studies; the trip there, as far as I can make out, there and back, being three guilders, unless the crossing to T. should prove difficult. But it would be worth it to be with a painter again, and will break the isolation. I must speak frankly about this because I had hoped until now that it would come right of its own accord, and that I would receive word in reply. I tried to prove that I didn’t lack courage by going to the Borinage, where life was most certainly much harder for me than it would have been had I become a student. I promise you that, I’ll make it appear as if I was talking about myself alone, as if I knew nothing about you. I have the very deepest contempt for this mysterious, sphinx-like silence &c., and I tell you here and now that I think all sorts of things about it, except for something that’s straightforward and honest or true. One could weep about what’s presently being spoiled in all sorts of areas, things to which our predecessors devoted their labours, honestly, are now being mean-spiritedly neglected and abandoned. The times we live in are perhaps outwardly a little more respectable than earlier days, but too much nobleness is being lost for us to be able to expect the same great things of the future that there have been in the past. Well, everyone has to make up his own mind. The fact is that I do need money and a stock of paint and various things before I can expect any results from the trip through the south-east corner of Drenthe. At first I had some trouble here with models on the heath, where people laughed about it and I was ridiculed and couldn’t finish figure studies that I’d started because of the unwillingness of the models, although I had paid them well, at least for these parts. I stood firm, though, and concentrated on a single family in that same place, where I can now get an old woman, a girl and a man, and have hopes that they’ll remain willing. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b349 a-b V/1962 On the last sheet of the letter Van Gogh wrote the beginnings of a paint order, which he never finished. See RM1My dear Theo, I forgot to reply to what you write about sending the you know what. For the time being would you send a postal order like the last, until I know of an exchange office — deduct expenses, though.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b350 V/1962 Date of postmark: Monday, 24 September 188Dear brother, I’m at a point where I need credit, trust and some warmth, and you see there’s no trust in me. You’re an exception to this, but precisely because everything falls on you it makes it even more apparent how dismal everything is in my case. And over and above all this, I’ve been overwhelmed these past few days by sombre feelings about the future, and also about the miserable state of my equipment as far as painting materials are concerned, the impossibility of doing the most essential, most useful things as they really should be done. It’s above all in this rainy weather, of which we have months ahead of us, that my hands are really tied. And then, what else can I do? — sometimes my thoughts take on a form — I’ve worked and economized and still not been able to avoid debt, I’ve been faithful to the woman and yet lapsed into disloyalty, I’ve abhorred intrigues and yet I have virtually no credit or possessions. I don’t regard your trust in me lightly, on the contrary, but I rather wonder whether I shouldn’t say to you, forget about me for we won’t get there — it’s too much for one, and there’s no chance of getting any relief from another quarter — is this not proof enough that we should give up? Oh, old chap, I’ve become so melancholy — I’m in magnificent countryside, I have a desire, indeed an absolute need to work — at the same time I’m absolutely at a loss as to how we’re going to get on top of it, when I think that my things are in the most miserable state and I’m here without a studio or anything, and will be embarrassed everywhere until I can improve matters. The models — they refuse to pose if there are bystanders around, and this is the greatest difficulty that makes a studio desirable. I have the same feeling now as I did when I set up the studio in The Hague — ‘if I don’t do it, I’ll certainly not be able to manage’. And even now, given The Hague, I don’t regret that I did as I did in those circumstances, only I wish I had come here 1 1/2  years earlier and set up a studio here instead of there. With a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b351 V/19My dear Theo, This morning the weather was better again and I went out to paint, regardless. Only it wasn’t possible, I was missing 4 or 5 colours, and so I came back again very wretched. I’m sorry I ventured so far without supplies — I know from prior experience how it can be if one undertakes an excursion like this without knowing that one will also get a response to reasonable, well-founded requests, and that they’ll be listened to. These are the precedents, brother, which I haven’t yet come to now, of course — but would come to if I were to venture far without security — if I weren’t to put my affairs in reasonable order — if, I say, I were to venture far into the countryside without backing. The expeditions I have in mind are impossible and madness if I undertake them without supplies. I’ve never before told you as plainly as this, and if I tell you now it is, I ASSURE YOU, not in the least because I mistrust you, but because since I planned the trip I haven’t yet spoken to you as seriously as this about the drawbacks and their relationship to what you might have available or be able to find for it. I’m bargaining for 2 lots of old paint, which only has some outward damage to the tubes, but, over and above this, brushes, canvas, watercolours and Whatman would also be needed. Ever yours, Vincent I must tell you frankly that lately I was sorry, and still am, that I paid my debt out of the money while I was in debt, but none of the people I paid recently was actually dunning me — although they have done in the past — and I could have put it off even longer. I don’t know, may one not take care of oneself first so that one keeps one’s hands and one’s energies free because, I repeat, you see that I won’t be able to get the studies I need painted before the winter, and who will thank me for that? Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b352 a-b V/19My dear Theo, How I wish that we could walk together here and — paint together. I believe that the countryside would win you over and convince you. Adieu, I hope that you’re well and will have a bit of good fortune. I thought about you again and again on this trip. With a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b353 V/19Nieuw-Amsterdam My dear Theo, There are often curious oppositions of Black and White here. For example, a canal with white sandy banks through a sooty black plain. You can see it above, too, small black figures against a white sky, and again gradations of black and white in the sand in the foreground. Furthermore, if you have personal energy, don’t wear it out, don’t let it get rusty, if things get miserable and one can’t count on anything, look for something simpler. Precisely because I have you to thank that I’ve been able to carry on thus far, I wanted to say to you that I don’t doubt for a moment that you would regard it as something wonderful if you had work for your hands, and even if initially it were to bring about the most impossible and conflicting relationships in your actual position in regard to life in general, nevertheless you would have a sense of ‘what does it matter to me’ to counter this, because of that view of the future. A future which, although it doesn’t depend entirely on making personal effort, would be more directly connected with it than things which aren’t manual work. With a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent. And never think ‘I’m not an artist’, because in so far as general gifts of energy and understanding are required, be assured that you have them. As I said, I’m going to Hoogeveen on 12 October, but then I’m coming back here. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b354 V/1962 The discussion begins where Vincent first conceives the idea that Theo would be more in his element as a painter in nature than as an art dealer in a world of insincerity, disinterest and the pursuit of profit. In part as a result of Theo’s reactions, Vincent becomes more and more strongly convinced that he is right, until he eventually agrees with Theo when he suggests ‘letting a little time go by’. We have relied predominantly on the following data in the reconstruction. First of all there are a few letters with known dates. Then there are (presumed) remittances, resumptions of subjects broached earlier and reactions to Theo’s answers which provide some reference points and indicate the course of the discussion. Finally, repetitions of striking formulations, words and expressions can be a reason for placing letters close to or after one another. Below we give an overview of the dating of the letters in question; we set out the arguments for this dating in the notes to the individual letters. In the present letter Van Gogh writes that he had walked around in Nieuw-Amsterdam ‘for a couple of days’ (l. 3). Some days had therefore passed since the previous letter written on or about Wednesday, 3 October, which was the first from this village. Moreover the letter was written at least a few days before 12 October, because he says that this is when he will be back in Hoogeveen again (l. 161). Although no exact date can be derived from this information, the letter has been dated on or about Sunday, 7 October 1883. The other attributed dates are then: ’Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore, And coming events cast their shadows before were often quoted. See The poetical works of Thomas Campbell. Ed. W.A. Hill. London 1854, pp. 102-107 (quotation on p. 105Dear brother, I now have to look back into my own past to see what the matter was, spending years in that stony, barren state of mind and trying to emerge from it, and yet it got worse and worse instead of better.  Not only did I feel indifferent instead of responsive to nature but also, which was much worse, I felt exactly the same about people. Here is the ground that sank beneath my feet — here is the ground which, if it sinks, must make a person miserable, whoever he may be. I was with G&Cie for 6 years — I had put down roots in G&Cie and I thought that, although I left, I could look back on 6 years of good work, and that if I presented myself somewhere I could refer to my past with equanimity. Suppose that your new employer is a man whose affairs are very mysterious, and suppose that he has just one goal, ‘money’. With all your energy, can you really immediately, at once, help him a very great deal in that? Perhaps not, eh? And yet he wants money, money come what may; you want to know something more about the business, and what you see or hear is pretty disgusting. So be aware of this, that in that respect I would of course do whatever you thought advisable. Now listen — write to me very soon — be sure to do that. With a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b355 a-b V/19I’m sending you the enclosed scratches to give you some idea of so many diverse things that the seemingly monotonous countryside has to offer. You see, I just take what’s there, I grab this and that by the neck; it will arrange itself and ripen of its own accord later. But I don’t want to begin here with a preconceived plan; on the contrary, I want my plan to ripen out of my studies. I don’t know the real character of the countryside as yet — now I’m doing everything I come across, and then later, when I have some experience, I want to try to convey it in what is fundamentally its most characteristic aspect. The one so much part of the other that one has to seize everything; however much one would like to concentrate, one may miss nothing. That’s to say, in order to see it like this one mustn’t look at the local colour in itself, but consider that local colour in relation to the tone of the sky. Write to me again soon because, as letters go, your last missive was remarkably brief — all too brief, but was also evidently written in the office.  Well, I’m very pleased that I’ve found a more suitable studio, precisely because it’s rather rainy and the bad weather can be expected any time, so as not to have to sit idle at home. I wish you could just see the countryside; it’s so inexpressibly beautiful in the evening. And it seems to me the snow will be gripping too. But before the ministers like the ones I saw here achieve the height of civilization and reason of common pigs, they have to improve a good deal more, and it will take centuries before they’re in that position. At the moment, any pig at all is much better, to my mind. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b355 c V/19My dear Theo, Now I’ve already written about it once, I’ve thought about it again since then, out on the heath. The same thing I’ve already thought about many times. I don’t think it wrong, but quite right to reason: I have to eat, live somewhere. Now not a day passes, so to speak, but that I make one thing or another. I can’t help but make progress precisely through learning by doing; every drawing one makes, every study one paints is a step. It’s true that it’s like going along a road, one can see the steeple in the distance, but the land undulates, so that when one thinks one is there, there’s another stretch that one didn’t see at first and which is added on. However, one does get nearer. In a while, longer or shorter, I don’t know how long, I’ll reach a point where I start selling. Very well, once I’ve reached that point, it won’t be by halves for I don’t do things by halves. And I’m doing different things at the same time; I’ll have more than one string to my bow, and hence more than one arrow too. So you see what I for my part can throw into the ‘bread’ gulf. Things can change for me, and if I’m still not selling now, with all my hard graft — I repeat, that can change.  Credit would have to be found for that, not without a security, but that security would be our work. The guarantee of this — I’m talking now about you and me working together — is that we’ll already have thrown a lot into it ourselves and have laid a certain foundation. What I can do, I can do, some aspects of drawing, yes and even some aspects of painting are firmly ingrained in me, and not in the least coincidentally but acquired through honest work. I say, yet another guarantee that we aren’t just talking hot air. Let me just suppose for a moment that you were at a point where you had to change — (you aren’t at that point yet, I’m just supposing it for a moment). Then you could get a position in another firm. Very well, but your more distant future, not the foreground but the background, the horizon, is that bright? It seems to me to be very much in darkness. Take, similarly, the more distant future if you become a painter; the darkness isn’t there but it’s close by, right in the foreground.  We’d have to have 1,500 guilders credit. I don’t know where and how it would be possible to come by it. I’ll work out for you what it would buy. We’d make an arrangement for 2 years with the man here, if necessary pay a sum in advance, I think that he’d do it for 1,000 guilders, give us both food for those two years, let us this room I’m living in now; in short, we’d be free of all domestic cares for 2 years and could work in peace and quiet. Two years is a long time, is all you’ll need in the circumstances to reach a certain level. We’d then have enough left over to lay in a big batch of paint, to set ourselves up properly. The bottom one, with a little delicate green wheatfield in the foreground and withered grasses behind the cottage and stacks of peat, is another glimpse of the heath, and the sky very light. You see, what I’m getting at is that you ought to start in that genre, and would do well from the outset, it seems to me, definitely not to draw exclusively. I mean everything I write to you here in absolute, absolute earnest, I’ve already thought about it for so long.  And wouldn’t have spoken about it if everything had remained well at G&Cie, but now, in the circumstances, it’s only because of my own wretched finances that I don’t say even more decidedly, come here straightaway. Otherwise I wouldn’t say anything more than that. The country is superb, superb, everything calls out to you: paint! So distinctive and so varied. Look, old chap, however things go, aren’t there always financial difficulties everywhere, and where are they less than here, and where or how on earth can a time of struggle lead to a more permanent peace? To a great peace that no one can disturb. For myself, I can say no more than that I’m willing to pledge all my own studies as security for the repayment of what we absolutely need for the first two years. What’s more, we don’t need all the money at once. I think it must be possible to find it. I suggest the minimum because both you and I would arrange things very economically. I cannot write other than as I write. Ever yours Vincent Do write again very soon. It bobs up and down — now you think: it will happen, then you think: it will never work, but the longer you go on the more you’ll learn to have collier’s faith. It will become more resolute even if there are still moments of bitter melancholy. I have a simple plan for myself; I’ll go out and make whatever strikes me, fill my lungs with heathland air, believe that in a while I’ll be fresher, newer, better myself. Come on, old chap, come and paint with me on the heath, in the potato field, come and walk with me behind the plough and the shepherd — come and stare into the fire with me — just let the storm that blows across the heath blow through you. Break out. I don’t know the future, how it could be different or not, whether everything will go well for us. But all the same I can’t speak otherwise. Don’t look for it in Paris, don’t look for it in America, it’s all the same, always exactly the same. Change indeed, look for it on the heath. Regards, write soon, with a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b362 a-c V/19Dear brother, Moreover, it’s curious enough, to my mind, that there’s a change in me too at this very time. That at this very time I come into surroundings that so mightily engross me, order, regulate, fix, renew, enlarge my thoughts, that I’m wholly absorbed in them. And can write to you full of what these silent, gloomy heaths engender in me. At this very moment I feel in me the start of something better. Something that isn’t there yet, but nevertheless I see in my work things that only recently I didn’t have. Meanwhile, a person has his roots, transplanting is a painful thing, even if the soil into which he’s transplanted is better for him. I don’t think that you’d be like a fish out of water then, but would feel something like a return to a native country — straightaway — a great serenity right now — you would be easier about becoming a painter than about a new post, or easier than at G&Cie even. I’ve now been breathing heathland air for a month, I absolutely needed it too — I went and sat by a peasant’s peat fire with a cradle beside it. I speak calmly, I think calmly now. Say a lot about it, say little about it; it’s all the same, it makes no difference. Well, in the future see yourself and me as painters. All at once people, even your best friends, become more or less like strangers. You’re involved with something else — precisely. All at once you think, blast, I’m dreaming, I’m on the wrong road. Where’s my studio, where’s my brush? We must treat the world with so much good heart, so much energy, so much coolness, not taking things too hard, you know — even if we had serious concerns — we must be cheerful like the Swedes you told me about, like the old Barbizon men. Take a large, strong, broad view. Not doubting, sitting dozing or letting ourselves be disconcerted. I’d feel at home with this plan, always much, much less at home with another plan. But I’ve said this and that about a plan I feel at home with — I don’t feel at home with the other. It’s an almighty gamble, but neither you nor I are afraid to hazard something. So think about it and in any event write soon. Regards, old chap, with a handshake in thought. Ever yours, Vincent What should you do? But you, you will keep silent you can’t act more coolly than that. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b356 a-b V/19Dear brother, I — who spent six years in it — who, although I was one of the lowliest employees, feels that something of my heart is still in it, even after more than 10 years — I find it bitterly, bitterly, bitterly sad. However, I mustn’t involve myself in situations that I’m only able to size up in the most general terms, and turn to what else you say about a plan of yours. Well, now I come to what you write about me. I would certainly very much like to spend some time in Paris, because I believe I would get the friction with artists that I’ll have to have at some point. For I should think that I would progress in my work if, for example, I had the opportunity to see more of printing. I also believe, moreover, that if one knows a craft, after all, a craft is the most solid means of existence, so all the more reason for me to continue seeking it there. Well, old chap, write again soon — I’ll start thinking all sorts of dreadful things if you keep quiet about it. So if there’s something the matter, write: there’s something the matter; if there’s nothing the matter, write: there’s nothing the matter, but don’t keep completely silent about it, because it’s not worth it. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b358 a-b V/19My dear brother, So these are my thoughts on certain questions about life. The whole discussion about them is one of the things that I describe as ‘boring’. Live — do something — and that’s more enjoyable, that’s more positive. If something in you yourself says ‘you aren’t a painter’ — IT’S THEN THAT YOU SHOULD PAINT, old chap, and that voice will be silenced too, but precisely because of that. Anyone who goes to his friends and complains about his troubles when he feels like that loses something of his manliness, something of the best that’s in him. Your friends can only be those who fight against it themselves, rouse the active in you through their own example of action. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b359 a-b V/19My dear brother — And so I can only, will only consider the situation in which you presently find yourself in so far as I have information, albeit vague, to make sense of it, and it isn’t by way of prediction. For myself, unless you were to write to me yourself: no it isn’t that bad — for myself I see that the affair has a fairly fatal look. In short, there’s a thus far and no further, and my premonition is that you’re close to it. Ever yours Vincent — Now then, the countryside here is very singular. The calamity leaves us our same courage and serious will. Let the world spitefully say what it wouldn’t refrain from saying, that can leave you and me cold. And on the contrary, for ourselves, we’re counting on a difficult life which has a goal other than earning as much money as we might perhaps do. We’ll do no one any harm by it.  The end of things doesn’t have to be an ability to explain but to base oneself on it effectively.  With a hearty handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b360 a-b V/19Dear brother, The door stands wide open like the entrance to a dark cave. The light from the sky behind shines through the cracks in the boards at the back. The whole caravan of masses of wool and mud disappears into this cave — the shepherd and a woman with a lantern shut the doors behind them. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b365 V/19My dear Theo, And what I believe does a great deal of good is if one doesn’t work absolutely alone, because the work inevitably absorbs one, but one doesn’t become lost in that absorption because each advises the other, can keep the other on the right path. And people would imagine your state of mind, if one were to talk about becoming a painter, as a delusion of a bed of roses. I have no patience with the ‘so-called’ common sense (fake article, inexpressibly different from the real thing) that one is supposed to use, that one is said not to use if one departs from the ordinary or takes a risk. I say, I have no patience with it. For me, it’s precisely because my natural common sense, if I use it to reflect, leads me to such very different results from the narrow-minded worldly wisdom and cautious, half-hearted sincerity of some people, that I have no patience with it. Ever yours, Vincent. Well, all the same it seems to me that one is acting against oneself if one isn’t willing to think things through, it seems to me that one is acting against oneself if (in one’s youth, above all) one doesn’t say: listen here, for my part I don’t want to rely on a system, I want to set about it according to reason and conscience. I even pay less heed to my own father (although he’s not bad, although I say nothing about him), than to those in whom I see more truth. And that I shall see the white ray before my eyes close. Well, I’ve thought about it for 4 years longer than you, I’m 4 years older and calmer — with me, time and experience have led me to drop and abandon certain things. And I don’t want to influence you, but neither do I want to conceal myself from you or do anything other than speak out forthrightly. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b363 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b374 V/1962 (sheet Theo, Well, old chap, if it should come to pass that you find yourself uprooted one fine morning before long, as if by a storm that has suddenly assumed amazing proportions, and increasingly start to feel that it had harmed you deeply, old chap, because something like that is terrible, and should yourself begin to doubt whether you still had the heart for trade — Theo, I’ve sometimes thought that the greatest poverty as an artist would be bearable, and productive too, if only one weren’t alone. In those few years we’ll have to see to it that at the end of it you and I together are earning as much as you now earn alone. And even if the intervening period is a bit of a rough ride for us all, we’ll just have to try to make up for it with a little warmth and love between us. But I see no good in your forcing yourself to take a new job against your inclination; on the contrary, I foresee that it would end in the whole thing coming to grief. I’m afraid, old chap, that if you get involved in new things, firstly you’ll waste time, secondly it will be a failure because the shock of being uprooted will be too much for you, thirdly you’ll lose more by it than you gain. If you still want to take this route and engage in Parisian or American or whatever business again, well then I would quietly let you go your own way, but I’ve stated my presentiments about this clearly enough overleaf. You decide for yourself whether I’ve got this wrong, to me it’s pretty obvious and clear that these consequences are highly likely. They’ll have to understand one thing at home — that, come what may, you and I will always have the same goal in view as we have now, namely to keep things going, not only ourselves but things in general. But that one path has been closed to us and we have to create a new one for ourselves, and for that we need them to keep quiet about it and not upset us, and on the contrary help us with it should that be needed. Our plan must be respected at home and not interfered with. There you have it, old chap, I can say no different. It unsettles me that I may not flatter you by saying that other things will work out well. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b364 V/19Theo, As to doubting oneself, whether one is an artist or not — that entire question is too much of an abstraction. I say that I have nothing against thinking about it, though, provided I may also draw and paint. And — my plan for my life is to make paintings and drawings, as many and as well as I can — then, when my life is over, I hope to depart in no other way than looking back with love and wistfulness and thinking, oh paintings that I would have made! But this doesn’t, if you please, rule out making what is possible. Do you have anything against this, either for me or for you? I wish that painting became such a fixed idea with you that the question, am I an artist or am I not an artist, was somewhat consigned to the realm of abstractions, and that more practical questions concerning putting a figure or a landscape together would come to the fore, being more enjoyable. In my view it would be an error of judgement if you were to continue in business in Paris. It is more difficult to contain Well brother, to change the subject, it’s snowing here today in the form of colossal hailstones. I say it’s snowing because of the effect. I’m keeping silent about the beauty of it here, because I would have TOO MUCH to tell you about it. As to work, I’m almost overbrimming because of the idea that you might start on it, which has a surprising hold on me. I wish it could be decided, precisely so that we could make definite plans for working together. Drenthe is so beautiful, it absorbs and fulfils me so utterly that, if I couldn’t stay here forever I would rather not have seen it at all. It’s inexpressibly beautiful. With a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b361 V/19Dear brother, Ever yours, Vincent There’s no more painting out of doors now, because it’s far too cold these days. But what a relief it would be for me if I could settle in these parts permanently. The rent is very low; if one only had company it would be such a wonderful thing to rent a peasant cottage and to arrange everything solidly and less precariously than in an inn. But Theo, how inexpressibly beautiful it is here. You can’t see that yet in my studies at all. I still have to learn a lot more to express how it really is here, and it’s also a question of time. And it’s therefore extremely difficult, I admit it, to know what one should do. Money plays a shameless role in society, and your feeling about this is a feeling that I also have on the subject. Only there’s such a lively hope in me that painting really would unleash our true capacity for work and still keep us going, even though the first few years would inevitably be extremely difficult. Look — winter is almost upon us, and here I am in the middle of the heath, and what else can I try to do right now besides work? But suppose that come the spring, in the month of March for instance, you’re still at G&Cie and on good terms, without the prospect of leaving. Then I would already call this staying permanently or definitely, and then seek to take another direction, or rather force myself into it due to an enormous predicament. Once more, with a hearty handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b366 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Consequently this is actually a deficit, because your next letter, namely the one that I’d otherwise have thought I could expect around 1 Dec., will probably not come. Because since I’ve been here in Nieuw-Amsterdam the letters have come later and later each time. If I’d received a word of warning in accordance with our agreement, it wouldn’t have engendered in me this feeling that, little by little, I cannot help getting slightly. Namely that some ambiguity is beginning to creep into our relationship, which began by being sincere, by mutually understanding and respecting each other. Well, that the above-mentioned is a disappointment to me and very palpably distresses me, even aside from thoughts that I can’t exactly help welling up in me, still isn’t the most pressing thing on my mind today. At this moment I don’t suspect you of insincerity — please hold on to that as my starting-point. Because I thus believe in you as an honest man, I reckon you to be relatively safe up till now despite everything, even in the event of a catastrophe. Well, old chap, do you take it amiss that I’m not completely at ease about you? And secondly, do you believe that I’m not confusing the things that concern you with my own affairs, as being in a sense dependent on yours? Although my affairs are dependent on yours, that isn’t what’s worrying me now — my worry is purely about you — about you as a human being — as a man — as an upright, honest man. As to my question, will you not suffer harm and go downhill — as a human being? If I bring myself to ask this question it’s because Paris is Paris. But I had to smile about what they wrote from home with a single, general word about a ‘good’ letter — and I know nothing more about it than this, and that it seemed that things had taken a more favourable turn. I thought: good — if you people say that you’re at ease, then let you people be at ease. I didn’t think any more of it than that, though.  You have your freedom, I have my freedom, to act as appears the most reasonable to us, haven’t we? And provided one always keeps this in the forefront — that one doesn’t blame the other or is hostile or becomes malicious, or makes the other’s life difficult on account of some difference of opinion — although there may be a time of greater coolness, at least things will, thank God, remain free of fantasy or intrigue. Which sadly isn’t always the case with everyone. And as regards the capital already invested in it by you and by me, for after all I’m investing my work, in fact every fibre of my being — as regards all this — I still have a real hope of its working out in the future — although, although — perhaps not only I, but you too for your part have been mistaken about a few things — which, however, aren’t yet fatal or irreparable in any event — and which I don’t even want to touch on now. Don’t regard this letter or previous letters as mistrustful, as suspicious, as insulting, regard them as a warning about some Parisian things that I ask you to consider, not as if I were infallible, not as if I’d demand that you agree with me — but because I believe I detect certain symptoms that seem to me to be of a puzzling and ominous nature. There you are, I’m being harsh now because I wanted to say straight out that I would be so very thankful if I was reassured on that point. I repeat, I don’t in the least ask for particulars. But the fact remains that there are men who fall in that way. And there are men who turn back in time. If a woman is simply good, well it’s a blessing — but there’s a danger, when the woman wants to shine in the eyes of the world, that she might make a man base. Mentioning this sickness isn’t the same as saying that this is your case, is it? — and on the contrary I ask, say one word and I’ll be completely reassured and not ask any more. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b367 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Thanks for your letter and the enclosure. Your letter explains your silence to me. But I see in this only a bad time that one has to get through. Something, though, which one can do very little about oneself — that is, about the attitude of the people whom one would so much like to have as models and can’t get. That my heart perhaps has and feels bitterness of its own is something that in my view you both understand and consequently forgive me out of yourself. Ever yours, Vincent I myself have nothing at the moment — but I’ll see if I can arouse some interest in certain plans of mine — or if no one wants to come back to Drenthe with me later on, then at least see if I can’t find some credit for myself so that I can settle there. I’m not flush, I have nothing. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b368 a-b V/1962 If only he had the courage to consider the possibility that the cause of much of what has arisen out of his eccentricity can be found in himself. But it doesn’t seem to me that he feels blame himself, but rather bitterness towards others, and particularly towards the gentlemen in The Hague. In his second letter, he says that he is financially embarrassed. He had expected your allowance, but it hadn’t come, and while the last you sent was more than he needed for his keep, he had purchased paints and canvas etc. for his work. Now he had to pay 14 guilders for his board and he noticed that the people were looking at him with suspicion. He asked me if it was possible to advance him the 14 guilders or if needs be half of it. I sent him a 14-guilder postal order by first post this morning. But my dear Theo, you must not put yourself in difficulty because of your generous allowance. I can well understand that you have your own concerns, and wouldn’t it be better if from now on we sent the intended share together? You half and we too? In your last letter you said ‘you don’t have to send him money’. It could also very well be that he has spent an unwisely large sum on requirements, without keeping any cash in hand. I am writing you all this to keep you informed. But let us be cautious towards him, for he is evidently in a perverse mood again. How much better it would be (if people dared risk it with him) if he were to board somewhere at a fixed price. But that would only lead to dissatisfaction again. Ma and I are naturally entirely under the impression of his last letters’. Part of the letter is missing herMy dear Theo, But first I must thank you for your letter of 1 December, which I’ve just received here in Nuenen. The last 3 weeks I was actually rather unwell — was troubled by various things that arose out of having caught a cold, and nerves as well. One must try to break something like that, and I felt that I would get worse if I didn’t have a change. I thought that being at home again might give me a more accurate insight into the question of what I should do. I see more and more that when one thinks or speaks about something, one by no means arrives at a satisfactory conclusion. At one moment it seems more possible than at another. And for my part I don’t let these things go at once but keep thinking about them, sometimes long after other people consider that they’re already decided. But, old chap, it’s so difficult for me, because for me it becomes so much a matter of conscience that I would be too much of a burden to you — perhaps abuse your friendship if I accept money for an enterprise that may not pay. True, there are real, sterling art lovers. But it’s perhaps only 1/10th of the total of the business that’s done, perhaps it’s even a much smaller proportion — of which it can be said: this or that transaction was genuinely out of belief in art. Consequently I don’t think about the art trade much. In my view, it can’t be very pleasant to be on hand for this — I’d rather sit by a peat fire, painting. The art trade, one feels a sort of ‘what do I care’ about it, except — except — except — that I personally find it very unpleasant if I’m really very short of money. I mean, it isn’t in your nature to fish in troubled waters. But I ask you frankly, what’s the position? Do you really believe that the people at Moniteur Universel will ask something different of employees from what G&Cie asks? In my opinion, setting up for oneself at a time when a cooling off and decline could be foreseen is something that one cannot do with any enthusiasm. Another thing is, if I can provide for myself by doing this or that here or there, I won’t look such a gift horse in the mouth. If it proves to be my duty to do this or that, very well, I won’t refuse the work, not even unpleasant work. Could it be just melancholy, that I can’t take the old pleasure in this or in that? In short, I thought, can I be mistaking gold for gilding? Am I mistaking something that’s in full growth for something withering? I couldn’t come up with an answer for myself. Can you? Do you know for sure that there isn’t already far-advanced, unrelenting decline on all sides? One of the drawbacks of a period like the one we’re entering is that a time when prices are inflated so high is, as it were, taking a lien on the future, which makes the future dark for posterity. Ever yours, Vincent. If you will, answer me some of these things while I’m here at home; I’m here to get some rest and resolution.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b369 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I lay awake half the night, Theo, after I’d written to you yesterday evening. Instead of readily understanding and consequently promoting both my and indirectly their own well-being with a degree of fervour, I sense a procrastination and hesitancy in everything, which paralyzes my own passion and energy like a leaden atmosphere. Will you think that I’m making too much of things? Our life is an awful reality and we ourselves go on into eternity, what is — is — and our view, weighty or less weighty, takes nothing from and adds nothing to the essence of things. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b370 V/19My dear Theo, It’s still early; I wanted to add a word or two to my letter of yesterday in order to try to make a few things clearer to you. But I ask you to regard what I tell you in this letter as something I would keep silent about if I didn’t think I could rely on your discretion and intelligence. That when I think about whether it’s right or wrong to accept money from you, I have to take appearances into consideration. My position vis-à-vis you now is this: on the one hand I believe that there’s still a possibility that your character, like mine, will go back on many of the things we were taught; yes, I say, I think it possible that you’ll have a change of heart, be it gradual, be it sudden, so that you’ll find yourself compelled to adopt another outlook on life, and that perhaps the upshot will be that you’ll yet become a painter. I don’t ask you to intercede, I ask you for something more personal, I ask you frankly: how do we stand towards each other; are you a ‘Van Gogh’ too? I hope you’ll understand me. If not, we’ll have to give it time. Who knows if, in the next 3 years, you won’t start to view some questions more or less as I do. Why? Because you’ll also be influenced by art and by mixing with artists, and in short may perhaps become squarer and broader in consequence instead of narrower and more constricted. Well old chap — if you can, see to it that I can get away from here — regards and believe me Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b371 V/19Dear brother, In short — it’s a dirty animal. Very well — but the animal has a human history and, although it’s a dog, a human soul, and one with finer feelings at that, able to feel what people think about him, which an ordinary dog can’t do. And I, admitting that I am a sort of dog, accept them as they are. On the other hand, dogs are guards. But there’s no need for that, it’s peace, and there’s no danger, there are no problems, they say. So then I keep silent. The dog is just sorry that he didn’t stay away, because it wasn’t as lonely on the heath as it is in this house — despite all the friendliness. The animal’s visit was a weakness that I hope people will forget, and one that he’ll avoid lapsing into again. I think you’ll be pleased that this has been done, it looked so careless. Dear Theo, In many respects, moreover, your answers to various passages in my letter make me see sides to the questions that aren’t unfamiliar to me either. Your objections are in part my own objections, but not sufficiently. So I see once more your good will, your desire at the same time to achieve reconciliation and peace — which indeed I don’t doubt. But brother, I could also raise very many objections to your tips, only I think that would be a long-drawn-out way and that there’s a shorter way. I’m deliberately leaving an interval for the sake of order and so that I’ll have time to take some steps that really have very little chance of success, but which my conscience won’t allow me to postpone in the circumstances.  I only have a quarter and a few cents in my pocket. So that is the account, which you will now understand when, in addition, you know that from the 20 Nov. money, which came 1 Dec., I paid for the lodgings in Drenthe for a long period, because there had been some hitch then that was later put right, and from the 14 guilders (which I borrowed from Pa and have since given back) I paid for my journey etc. I’m going from here to Rappard’s. Let me tell you that I didn’t know that someone aged 30 was ‘a boy’, particularly not when he may have experienced more than just anyone in those 30 years. Regard my words as the words of a boy if you wish, though. It may be politic to keep what one thinks to oneself, however it has always seemed to me that a painter, above all, had a duty to be sincere — you yourself once pointed out to me that whether people understand what I say, whether people judge me rightly or wrongly, didn’t alter the truth about me. Ever yours, Vincent. In some cases, after all, a man’s age may be an added strength. Since I know that our thoughts crossed each other in our first years with G&Cie, that is that both you and I thought then about becoming painters, but so deeply that we didn’t dare to say it straight out then, even to each other, it could well be that in these later years we draw closer together. All the more so because of the effect of circumstances and conditions in the trade itself, which in the meantime has already changed compared with our early days and, in my view, will go on changing more and more. And it was precisely the biased view of seeing base objectives &c. in me that made me very cold and fairly indifferent towards many people. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b372 a-b V/1962 (sheets 1, 2) and b375 V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, I think a lot about those words of his these days. Now my idea may be somewhat overstated — the reality less pronounced in its contrasts — less absolutely dramatic — yet I believe the rough character sketch is fundamentally true. The shaggy sheepdog I tried to get you to understand in my letter yesterday  it’s my character, and the animal’s life is my life, if, that is, one leaves out the details and simply gives the essentials. This may seem exaggerated to you — but I don’t take it back.  Something better than the time of the Rijswijk mill — namely the same once and for all — two poor brothers, artists — bound up in the same feeling for the same nature and art — will it ever come to that? Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b373 V/19My dear Theo, As for your advice ‘don’t talk to them about certain things’, you should know, I believe that you have something well-observed in mind.  If you could agree with me in this, I’d say to you, Theo, they’re equally insensitive now, and you would understand it. You’ll point out to me something I’ve thought of myself, that I personally am also difficult to get on with in many respects. Yes, there’s that, too, and I take it into account too. There’s an excuse for me, and that is the passion as well as the frequent absorption that everyone who paints, writes or composes must have by the very nature of the thing. A normal person, you or I, if we’d done something like that, we would, I believe, I hope, I trust, have regretted it long, long since, whether we were at fault or were right. There are a mass of reasons for this — oh, Theo, if you saw everything that I see in it! How much certainty it would give us for the future! I hope that it’ll prove possible. So let’s stand by that, and let this letter, and not my last, be our starting-point. Ever yours, Vincent. He immediately followed that up with, ‘but we don’t lack conciliation’. You see how I am, brother, and you may make of it what you will, but don’t get the idea that I’ll enter into this sophistry of conciliation with irreconcilability. Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b376 a-b V/1962 (sheets 1, 2) and b377 V/1962 (sheet The Hague. My dear Theo, Anyway, when time has passed it will, I think, be conducive to arriving at a solid result. I really do feel that it would be hard to begin again. Well, I write in haste. With a handshake. Ever yours, Vincent. But of course I won’t be here long. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b378 V/1962 At first it seemed to be hopeless, but it has gradually got better, particularly since we agreed that he will stay with us for the time being, to make studies here. He wanted the mangle room to be fitted up for him. We don’t think it’s a particularly suitable place, but we’ve had a decent stove put in there. We are having a sort of wooden foot-rest made, since the room has a stone floor. We had it spruced up and have even had a bed put in there, also on a wooden foot-rest, so that it won’t be unhealthy. Now we shall just make it nice and warm and dry and then it should do. I wanted to have a large window put in, but he prefers it without. You know that once he has made his plans there is no changing them and so he left, to return within a few days so he has said. We should rather that he had just left The Hague alone, but the matter of his drawings and other artist’s tools made it necessary, so he declared. Anyway, we’re undertaking this new trial with real good faith and are resolved to leave him completely free in his eccentricities of dress etc. The people here have seen him now, and although it’s still a pity that he isn’t a little more accommodating: there’s simply no changing the fact that he’s eccentric. It seems that he’s still pretty much occupied with your plans and future; but you will be wise enough not to let yourself be talked into things that aren’t practical. For that is certainly his trouble, alas! It is certain that he works hard and that he finds plenty of material for studies here. He made various ones that we think are good. It seems that he still has something to pay to the supplier of paints. I wanted to give him money for it; but he refused categorically – he has now left with 25 guilders on him – including the 23 guilders you just sent’ (FR b2250My dear Theo, I came back to Nuenen yesterday evening, and now I must get what I have to tell you off my chest straightaway. Now that we’ve parted we’ll remain parted, only looking back we regret that we didn’t choose a middle way instead, and even now there remains a mutual attachment that has roots or grounds that go too deep to be transitory. Now I have to tell you a few things that I won’t return to again after this — which you may take as you will — which you’re at liberty to reflect about or to dismiss — that’s not my business — you must decide that for yourself. For I now see more clearly how you and others appeared to wish that I should part from her. I don’t doubt the good intentions. The levers that worked on me so that I was unsettled, and with which you were at least to some extent concerned — were, first, touching on an infinitely tender question from the past that troubled me, secondly your saying that ‘my duty’ would perhaps lead me to part. Well — if what you said had been entirely isolated — I wouldn’t even mention it — but it’s too much like the feelings of other people with whom I also differ for me to be able to regard your opinions as being entirely isolated. I accepted your point of view — although probably with intentions very different from what you imagine, and concerning which time will clear up one thing and another for you that now isn’t the time to discuss. You drew my attention to a case where it ‘had worked well’ that a certain man had left a certain woman. Well, our friendship, brother, has taken a heavy blow from this, and if you should say, we were certainly not mistaken, and if you should reveal yourself to me to be of exactly the same mind now as you were then — I would no longer be able to esteem you precisely as I did in the past. I don’t say that no change or alteration was necessary, but — I think we (or rather I) went too far. Now that I have a studio here, perhaps more than one financial difficulty is less fatal. I end by saying, think about it if you will — but if, after what I’ve told you, your sentiments remain precisely the same as this summer, I can no longer have the same respect for you as I did before. Incidentally, I’ve also resolved not to say another word to you about a possible change in your circumstances or career. For I see as it were two natures in you, struggling with each other within you — a phenomenon that I also see in myself, but there are still, perhaps, a few questions fermenting in you that in your eyes have already been resolved for me because I’m 4 years older. Think about what I’ve said, that would be very good, although you can also dismiss it. But for my part I wanted to talk to you frankly about it, and can’t conceal my feelings from you. With a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent And on the other hand, our cruelty can be infinite too. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b379 a-b V/19My dear Theo, For I foresee that later (perhaps much later) you’ll regret much of what you now take to be right. For the time being I don’t have to give you any reason why I think that, because you wouldn’t believe me. As to the money — brother — you understand that I don’t take any pleasure in it any more, don’t you? You do understand that, don’t you? I did take pleasure in it because it meant not only my survival, but also that of those poor creatures. Yours truly, Vincent I know very well that this is a sore point that relates to the financial aspect. Not only in the sense you refer to in your letter, but in the first place in another. If I accept money from you and do something you declare yourself to be directly opposed to, that would be wrong. I’ve always talked openly to you about everything, and revealed myself just as I was, tried to be honest, but I haven’t acted without consulting you. Very well, should this stop and should we not know each other in our private lives any more, there would be something false about our position. And that I decline. But I feel it when something has been broken. And I say, what’s broken is broken. If I do this, at least I’ll regain my serenity, I would lose my serenity if I wasn’t frank enough. I dare to face the future provided — I don’t enter into things that I’d feel were dishonest. Vincent True cowardice on my part, brother, would be to be ambiguous about this. If it had to come to it that I myself had nothing, very well — that would be the worst, and there would still perhaps be others besides you who would make my life possible, to some extent. And if not — well, then not. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b380 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b215 a-b V/1962 (sheets 2, My dear Theo, All the more so because in later years, if we live to see them, you may perhaps not really carry on believing in what you now take to be certain. But that’s not the issue now. So, for instance, I’ve been studying the weavers while I’ve been here. Do you know many drawings of weavers? I only very few. Certain truths and facts, on which our opinions have little or no effect, and which I hope I don’t confuse with mine or others’ opinions, which would be a mistaken point of view. Just as weathercocks have no effect on the direction of the wind, so opinions have no effect on certain standard truths. The weathercocks don’t make the wind east or north, any more than any opinions whatsoever make the truth true. But then in his misery he began to read that book, and he learned things from it. So that he was able to make life more bearable for himself, and invented different things to rescue himself from his difficulties. So that at last he acquired a certain control, although always by working and as if through a struggle. ‘Gold’, that isn’t only money, but it’s an image of a lot of other things as well. Wishing you success with your affairs, Yours truly, Vincent I once read an interesting remark somewhere that people really do go on changing as they get older. I mean, until late in life both in art and very certainly no less ‘as a human being’, until late in life one may have certain stiff, rigid, let’s say steely ways of doing things, both of observing and of working, and may yet come later in life to milder, to more intelligent, to more reasonable, to more humane views. Just want to point out that it’s perfectly possible that, both as a human being and as a workman, you could come to more nature, to more rest, to more ‘your own self’. Just want to point out that I don’t find you natural, the way you sometimes are nowadays, for example last summer in The Hague. This means nothing for the time being — and is in no way regarded by me as your fixed and irrevocable character or state of mind, but as a curious phenomenon. Which I observe with interest and reflection, precisely because I myself have also known moments of that state of mind, precisely at a time when I was close to a reversal in my own mind. Well. That, moreover, it would be necessary to use tricks and false testimony in such proceedings in order to give a semblance of justice to an impediment placed in the way of any marriage I might be contemplating. That should people ever stand in my way in such a case, I, for my part, would defend myself very calmly and collectedly, and would stand up for my rights and not give in.  Realizing as I did that it would be a case in which the judge himself would urge the necessity of an amicable settlement. A whole lot of things would have to happen before I changed my mind in that regard, and they’re out of the question now. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b381 a-c V/19My dear Theo, Brother, know that I repeat what I said before, without change, about how you have helped me nobly — and that: I must take measures such that I have what I have. I would rather have 100 francs a month and free use of it, than 200 francs and not entirely free use of it. I would wish it to remain the usual until March. That will enable me to pay everything I have to pay, and to provide myself with a few things by way of materials. First order of business that has to be dealt with. You’ll say that you leave me free — yes, but there’s still a certain awkwardness. You mustn’t take this to mean that I want nothing to do with you any more, the opposite is true — you’re a dealer. Very well, if I make something saleable in your view, I would even rather sell it to you than to someone else, but it must be an arrangement such that my position doesn’t become false as a result, so I really do want a sale in the literal sense. You can take this, too, just exactly as you like, I think that what I say is understandable. I thank you for your letter, I appreciate many things in it. Regards, and believe me Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b394 V/19My dear Theo, Yesterday evening I received your letter and the 100 francs enclosed. I can tell you that I’m now at a point where I can cover my deficit of last year, having had fewer expenses because of my stay here. I point this out to you so that you can see from it how I dislike disorderliness in affairs as much as you do, and also insist on meeting my obligations to people. I’ll indeed really try to carry on with my work, and you mustn’t think that I’m any different from before as regards working every day here. All’s well that ends well, says the proverb. I owe a great debt to you, though, and I would make it worse and worse were I to continue on exactly the same footing. Now I have a proposal to make for the future. Let me send you my work and you take what you want from it, but I insist that I may consider the money I would receive from you after March as money I’ve earned. And I don’t mind at all if it’s not as much at first as I’ve been receiving up to now. For my part I say decidedly that, whatever you may think about what I’ve received from you so far, for myself I consider it as something that I’ll repay if possible. If things work out, I really will pay it off. There can be no question of that for the present, and so we won’t mention it. And from March onwards I’ll start to send work here and there regularly. And to you first — but don’t consider yourself obliged to take something from me if you don’t really care for it yourself. I should think that this would mean that, however much our feelings may differ or come to differ, we wouldn’t even have to talk about it, much less quarrel. If you don’t want to enter into that other proposal, then you must leave it. Moreover, whatever differences in feelings there may be about this or that, something that I hope really will remain is that we’re brothers and will conduct ourselves as brothers. I don’t think there’s been a day since I’ve been here when I haven’t sat working with the weavers or peasants from morning till night. I’ll be very pleased if you approve of my proposal. Then, in my view, we’ll avoid extremes and steer a steady course. If you know of something better, I’d like to hear it. Regards, and I thank you for what you sent. With a handshake.

Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b389 V/1962 Date of postmark: Wednesday, 13 February 188My dear Theo, Everything lives, everything loves! And I, sad and alone,  Stand like a dead tree against the vernal sky I can no longer love, I who have lived but thirty years, And have my mistress lately quit without regrets.  I am like a sick man, his thoughts grown dull And wearying of his stale, familiar room, His sole amusement, stupid and mechanical, To count inside his head his carpet’s flowers. Sometimes I wish my end were near,  And all these recollections — once so sweet, I thrust away, as from the portrait of an ancestor Whose gaze disturbs us, we turn away our eye. Even of that old love, that drew so many tears, No trace remains in this, my jaded heart. O, thou figure in my thoughts, veiled and dim,  Whom I may meet tomorrow, whom I know not yet, A courtesan, leaning at table ’mid the remnants of a meal, Or — a woman, sober-minded, eyes downcast and pale. Appear! — if yet this wretched heart, empty of desire, Its flame extinct, you can again ignite, And all of nature blooming in a kiss. Come! — As sailors on a foundering ship Throw — to win an hour’s respite — a treasure to the deep — Come! — I promise you all, heart and soul — blood and flesh, and then this: Divine hope that two together come to form And two together share, The hope to love long, love always, love More dearly every day; Desire eternal — touching and chimerical, That lovers sigh — When — blissful moment — searching each other out, Their lips exchange a mutual breath. That vain, illusory desire, that cheating hope, Whereof we never spoke; It pains me to see we are afraid of it, Though it be in our souls. And when to your questioning I, your sweetheart, Murmur a soft response, The word is — evermore — Without my uttering it, And though its dear echo sounds within your heart, Your silence is the same When on your breast, languorous unto death, I swear I love you. What signifies the past — what of time to come? For what is best of all, Is to believe that it should never end, That hour’s illusion. And when I tell you, ‘Evermore!’ — do naught That might dispel that dream, And may your kiss on mine Press all the longer and more tenderly. Sorrow assuaged You whom I saw as like the blasted oak, I find you now a father, find you spouse; And yet to that brow that dreamed of death’s release, A pistol once was held. All that you cannot have forgotten quite; You knew how one suffers and despairs; You carried in your heart the viper vile  Of a great love lost, a great hope — crushed. Oblivion eluded you — you sought out  Tumults, orgy and its songs — fame and its jibes And the long roaring of the sea and of the wind. Who, then, unto your sorrow put a silent stop — O Lonesome one — ’twas but the rhythmic beat and then this — A wound reopened O, my heart, are you then so craven and so weak? And would you be like a convict, dragging his ball and chain,  Who, though released, yet hobbles still? Be silent — well you know the sentence she has passed on you. I will no longer suffer, and thus I order you: If I should feel you swell once more and writhe, May I — with a stifled sob — crush you; And — no one shall know of it — and — to still my cries, They’ll see me — for that ghastly minute, I have to keep the pen drawings for another week or so because I still need them to finish off other things that I started at the same time. But you’ll get them soon — but do please let me know whether the parcel arrived safely, and whether there were enough stamps on it. Because drawings possibly count as written matter and more has to be paid on them. Regards — I hope you’ll be able to do something with all of this. Yours truly, Vincent It’s not that she was so beautiful, But we were both twenty, And that day, as I recall Was a spring morning. It’s not that she looked so serious, But here and now I swear That never have I dared do a more courageous thing Than when I told her that I loved her. It’s not that she had a tender heart,  But it was so delightful To talk to her, to listen to her speak, My eyes would fill with tears. It’s not that her soul was hard,  From then my sadness takes its date, When we go home, at night, through empty city streets, And see upon the wet, green, greasy mud Long streaks of gaslight, more of them every day, Often a stray dog with matted coat, a dreadful, doleful sight, An old dog from hereabouts, which its master, penniless, Has thrown out with a kick — perhaps mourning it — Will stick its stubborn nose into your heels, And if you should turn back, give you a look, And what a look — long, fearful, all cajolery, A mistress’s, a poor man’s touching gaze, Yet hopeless, with that uncertain air belonging to A woman scorned and a poor man who feels his shame. And if you stop, he’ll stop with you, and Feebly wag his wet and drooping tail,  Timid, knowing his fate lies in your hands. He seems to say: ‘Come on — take me with you — please?’ We’re moved — and yet we don’t quite dare; We’re poor ourselves — and rabies is a fearful thing. And then — unkindly — making as if to raise Our stick — we tell the dog: ‘Go on, be off with you!’ And — all contrite — he goes to plead his cause elsewhere. You carry, my handsome officer, With perfect grace, Your sword with hilt of steel, But I think of our defeat. This pelisse of finest stuff Sets off your figure perfectly; You’re charming; but after all We lost the battle. We read your intrepidity In your black eyes under their slender brows. Nothing wrong with wearing fancy gloves — But, they took two provinces from us. At your age one’s always proud Of a little bit of braid; But — do you see — ’twas yesterday They maimed our motherland. Lieutenant, I do not know If of an evening, a finger to your brow, Holding book and compasses, You stay up late, beside the lamp. Are your men your children? Are you their leader and their father? I wish to believe that, and would fight off A doubt that fills me with despair. Stripes on your sleeve, on your way,  Is it of deliverance you think? — Young man, give me your hand, Let’s give a little shout — ‘Vive la France!’ I met her in a bourgeois drawing-room – Her gentle, timorous eyes, her banished angel’s brow, First drew me to her – and I was told She’d separated from a brutal spouse. Still she kept company with those old friends Whose home had known her as a growing child And who, despite the talk that makes folk take offence, Cared not a jot for all their cruel prejudice. But she knew well enough – sweet and resigned – That wider circles were all barred to her,  Ever expecting – quiet and calm – The word that snubs, the greeting that rebuffs. And so, on evenings when they neither dined nor danced, She’d come and broider there among them, by the hearth, And there it was (seeing her so fresh and young) I was amazed to see she wore a wedding ring. Stoical, accepting of her curious widowhood Without a backward thought; naively, too, To show she kept her faithful vows, Her hand retained enslavement’s evidence. Dark-haired and pale she was – twenty-five years old – Her long, proud hands were veined with blue And the long lashes fringing her chaste eyes Cast fluttering veils across her nut-brown gaze. No gem, no ribbon, not a hint of gaiety, Never the smallest flower inserted in the chestnut-coloured band, The little collar – white and demure – Stood out alone against her dress of mourning silk. Sewing there, unhurried, with an easy hand, Confident of shadow’s power to transform, She kept the darkest corner of the room; She scarcely spoke, and wished to be forgot. But when she answered with a casual word or two The humdrum questions that were put to her, Painful it was to hear that voice, Broken by suffering and made for tenderness. That pure, slow voice, weary from prayer, Once interrupted by a master’s powerful tones, And forced, perhaps, to cry aloud from fear and shame By insults, or an arm upraised. And when a little child went round the company Offering its forehead to receive a kiss, how ling’ringly, With what a keen and melancholy pang She placed her lips upon the flaxen head. But straight upon this all too cruel delight How quick she was to take her needle up again! And what a sudden blush spread o’er her cheek, Conscious of regrets made palpable. For I could see, kindly though we were, That she was pitied for her miserable choice; That this community, timid, respectable, Retained its fear – quite natural, I’d say. Clearly I observed her humble gaze Falter if it should meet a sparkling eye, How she avoided all the younger girls, And looked none but the old men in the face. Young man, who could love this unhappy one – Your paths will surely cross some day – Don’t look at her, say not a word to her, Don’t let her love you, that would be unspeakable! Look, I know the skill, the subtle wiles Of sophistry as well as you. I know its piercing eye, its voice that penetrates,  And how the blood will surge through your rebellious veins. I know that quite defenceless, she succumbs, I know she beats her breast before the Cross, That she’d adore you like a god, or like a son; I know your triumph is assured. Yes, I’m sure for you she’d sacrifice Her only treasure – honour, faithful, pure. And that you’d gladly live and die with her. That’s fine. But equally, I know ‘twould be the death of her. Obsessed by these words, widowhood and autumn, My reverie seeks no other to express This melancholy, vast and monotonous, That robs me of all hope and all desire to love. Ceaselessly it evokes a long, long avenue Of plane trees, immensely tall, half bare, In which a woman in deep mourning, veiled, Moves slowly forward on the pallid grass. Her long skirts leave behind a wake, Trailing and rustling in the fallen leaves; She follows with her gaze the passage of a cloud Before the wind, driving from the north, already cold. She thinks of him, now absent, who was wont to say: I love you! And under the wide low sky from which the light has gone, Sees that, with the last chrysanthemum, yesterday The last butterfly has also died. And so she walks across the faded grass, Weary of wishing, weary of submitting, And always in her path, the plane-tree leaves Fall with a sound as sad as sighs. — In vain — to chase away these gloomy images Do I call up my youth, and that splendid summer. I do not trust the sun, no more believe the roses, And go about, head lowered, like a haunted man. My heart’s so full of autumn and of widowhood That I forever dream, under a pure, clear sky — Of one in mourning — in a chill landscape, And the leaves falling at first winter’s wind. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b390 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b1471 V/1962 (sheet 2)   Van Gogh did copy the striking layout of the lines: no spaces between the stanzas and an indent after every second linMy dear Theo, I certainly wouldn’t put up with it in the long run. For your part, you can also continue to speak frankly. Well, you see that my answer is that I send some new ones — and I’ll very willingly go on doing so — Id like nothing better than that. Only you must be totally frank for once — which is what I’d prefer — as to whether you think you’ll bother yourself with them in the future, or whether your dignity won’t permit it. Leaving aside the past — I’m facing the future, and not counting what you think of them, I fully intend to try to do something with them. But the painter would be foolish to send them on commission if he could tell that the dealer considered his work to be something that shouldn’t see the light of day. Now, old chap — we both live in the real world — and precisely because we don’t want to put a spoke in each other’s wheels, we must speak candidly. If you say — I can’t be bothered with them — very well, I won’t get angry about it — but then I’m not obliged to believe that you’re an absolute oracle either, am I? You mustn’t take it amiss that I mention it, brother. Whether you’re right or wrong about this — I’m not going into that. You’ll tell me that I’ll be treated by other dealers exactly the same as by you, except that, although you can’t be bothered with my work, you furnish me with money anyway, and other dealers certainly won’t do that, and without money I’ll become completely stuck. And this is very understandable. Well, it’s very wretched for me always being in a false position. Well — but you’ll perhaps think differently about it. And you’ll say that it’s also pretty sad when a painter dies miserably in a hospital and is buried with the whores in the common grave — where a lot of them lie, after all — particularly when one considers that dying may not be as difficult as living. Yours truly, Vincent I say it as I see it, not to make you wretched but to get you to see and feel if possible the reason that I no longer think of you as a brother and friend with the same pleasure as before. There has to be more zest in my life if I want to get more brio into my brush — I won’t get a hair’s breadth further by exercising patience. If, for your part, you relapse into the above-mentioned, don’t then take it amiss if I’m not the same towards you as I was in the first year, say. If one goes from bad to worse — this wouldn’t be impossible in my case — what would it matter? If one is badly off, one has to take a chance of making things better. I found the idea that our relationship might not last almost unbearable at first. And I so very much wished that it had been simple to change things. However I can’t always keep on fooling myself that this can be done against the grain. At first I thought it was only half sincere — then later, and now, still, I think it very understandable and think it more a mistake on my part that I wrote to you, become a painter, than on yours that you resumed your affairs with enthusiasm when they became more possible to resume and the machinations making it impossible for you ceased. Do you see why it wasn’t an irresponsible action on my part, and wouldn’t be if I were to try it again? We’d perpetually return to the same questions. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b391 a-d V/1962 – Last night’s storm, no doubt, said Anne de Beuil… the whole house shook.” And they looked at each other with their closed, cold faces.’ (“Qu’est-ce qu’il a?” demanda Anne de Beuil. Jeanne haussa les épaules: “Toujours la même chose...” Elle ajouta: “Tu diras à Jégu de remettre un verrou à ma chambre... Celui qui y est ne tient plus. – L’orage de cette nuit, sans doute, dit Anne de Beuil... toute la maison sautait.” Et elles se regardaient avec leurs faces fermées et froides.) See Daudet 1986-1994, vol. 3, p. 299. Originally Van Gogh noted immediately after ‘women’: ‘Et elles se regardèrent de leurs visages froides et fermées’, but he crossed this line ouMy dear Theo, It would disappoint me a bit to get these little weavers back. And if nobody else you know wants to take them on, I’d think this is an article that perhaps you could take for yourself, in order to bring together a number of pen drawings of Brabant artisans, with this as the start. Which I’d be happy to undertake and — on the assumption that I’ll be in Brabant quite a lot now — would be very keen to do. However, for my part I’ll go along with what you think best in this regard. And you see that it isn’t my endeavour to break off business with you — only, I’ve pointed out to you that it occurred to me that it might be useful to show the drawings as I send them. Well, regards. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b392 V/1962 and b397 e V/1962 Millet’s dramatic pose, unmanned by melancholy and sitting with his head in his hands, does not occur anywhere in Sensier. All he said – aside from what has been quoted above – was: ‘Millet’s first marriage had been most unhappy’ (Le premier mariage de Millet avait été bien malheureux). Sensier 1881, p. 83. Van Gogh himself made several drawings of this subject (inspired by English wood engravingsMy dear Theo, Well, at least this is something manly. Shouldn’t we just apply that same system to it? Come on, brother — you’ll probably find it ‘not brotherly’ of me that I most definitely rank our friendship as it now stands under things without spirit — but in the past I would certainly have taken it very much to heart, this question of being brotherly or not brotherly. And now — I won’t take it to heart. And I don’t much care what you’ll think of me. Which, for that matter, I’m afraid you’ll come to suffer from more and more. On one condition, though — that in the meantime my life wasn’t too lonely and wretched, my position not too false, but I could resign myself to the present with a feeling of freedom — I wouldn’t even mind waiting a very long time before my work was shown. When I read your recent letters, what I see from them is that you’re contriving to make it seem that the whole thing is my fault if we split up. That’s such a mean Van Goghish trick, such a bit of self-righteousness, that you can have with great pleasure if you’re attached to it. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent I know in advance that I’ll be sorry, and even very sorry at times, if we split up. And perhaps — although there’s no inconvenience or worry associated with it for you — you for your part will also sometimes find it half-and-half less pleasant. Speaking of brotherly, are these things part of brotherliness? And — how can I find something like you write: SO just have a little more patience, anything but insufferable? So there you have it, I need my patience for my work, my friend, and if I’m rather short-tempered with you and other people it’s because it’s cowardly to fob someone off with something like ‘so just have a little more patience’. You must do exactly as you wish, but for my part I can’t swallow everything whole. It seems to me that G&Cie were rather orthodox and tended to look down on other houses as if they themselves were better than other dealers. Well they were, and still are, all tarred with the same brush. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b395 a-b V/1962 (sheets 1, 2) and b414 c V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, It surprised me a little that I haven’t heard from you. Because you write: ‘if it isn’t convenient for you to wait, write to me by return’. Very well, I wrote back to you that as far as being convenient to wait longer, it indeed certainly wasn’t — but I got a less direct response to that. This is precisely what my letter was about — that where our friendship was really beginning to flag in my view, this wasn’t stimulating &c., which I don’t need to repeat. Yours truly, Vincent From the very circumstance that you don’t have the usual yet again this month — you might like to consider that we won’t cope by keeping up such appearances. Were it not the case that I feel more strongly by the day that I need something more, I would keep my studies quietly to myself. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b396 V/1962 There are two painters’ names and the name of a collector, probably in Theo’s handwriting, on p. [1r:4My dear Theo, This way of mine of regarding you and your money balances your way of regarding me and my work — and as long as it remains in balance — I’ll accept it. You write that you had tried to answer my letters, but had left off. For my part, too, I had wanted to write to you since then, but also left off. Know that if you don’t want to do anything with the work you buy from me, or tear it up if need be, this will be no reason for me not to do my best in it. I’d just like to come back to your letter about my drawings — the one you say I’ve interpreted utterly impossibly. I see in it first that, among the things you say, there are a few whose tenor is that there were things that pleased you in the tone, in the sentiment — so much the better — if you will, that gives me a good deal of pleasure. That was the question that it was all about, and since my work depends on my paint and tools (to an extent that I can’t ignore), and they in turn on whether or not I receive money, I can’t possibly ascribe much usefulness to that letter. The frame of mind in which you now are about me, the frame of mind in which I now am about you, is cool enough simply to ask and to reply coolly. After all — leaving aside — giving a damn about each other or not — can I count on its being fixed for 1 year that I’ll continue to receive the usual monthly in return for supplying my work? Why I have to know this is because, if I can count on it, I would take a slightly roomier studio somewhere, which I need in order to be able to work with a model. To which I say — I don’t care whether or not you’re aware that this or that isn’t quite in order, as long as you just don’t ask me to walk round befuddled about it, and as long as you give me the means to improve things I have no objection to your being ‘aware’ of all sorts of things. I hope this letter is as cool as yours — and I thank you very much for what you sent — which makes up for the rest — at least makes it such that, if I could count on its continuing thus for a year, I ask nothing more of you and will right gladly send you my work. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b398 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b397 d V/1962 (sheet 2) The letter is not signed, so it may be incompletMy dear Theo, That I would like, though — would even like very much — nothing better than that — to go on in the same way, provided there’s a specific agreement about supplying work. And that to try this out I would send one thing and another by March. As far as my work is concerned, up to now it was indeed apparently the case that you would rather I didn’t send something than that I did. But you have to decide entirely of your own accord whether or not our relationship will endure in the future — for the current year, say. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b397 a-c V/1962 On these grounds we have spaced the two letters evenly in the remaining 11 days in March: on or about Monday, 24 March and on or about Friday, 28 March 1884 respectivelMy dear Theo, There’s all the more reason for it, particularly because he’s further on than I am. I say this simply to prevent you from being negligent. But I know very well that he liked the work of mine that he’s seen these last few months. I would rather that I could tell him all was well between you and me. But I won’t harp on about this either. If you want to divide art with sharp, dead straight lines into things that one may bring into the open and things that one must persistently leave alone — that’s your business. And at this moment the whole question is so downright odious to me that I don’t want to pursue it any more. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent He’s a nice boy now, it seems to me, but it’s time that he did something practical, it seems to me, otherwise they go to seed, these young fellows, particularly if they end up in a rather too empty little office — go to seed in pedantry and nonentity. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b399 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b414 d V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, I wish his arrival might coincide with yours. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b400 V/1962My dear Theo, Am really looking forward to your next letter. I recently also saw coloured pieces woven in the evening — where I’ll take you sometime should you come here. When I saw it, they were also just arranging the threads, so dark, bowed figures against the light, which stood out against the colour of the piece. Great shadows cast on the white walls by the laths and beams of the loom. Regards — do write soon if you can. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b401 V/1962My dear Theo, It will always be a sadness to me, though, that I had to give something up then that I’d have liked to pursue further at the time. I’ve recently been getting on better with the people here than at the outset, which is worth a great deal to me, for one has a definite need to be able to give oneself a little distraction, and when one feels too lonely the work always suffers in consequence. One must, however, perhaps prepare oneself that these things won’t last for ever. My original plan of settling in Brabant — which fell to pieces — I must confess is attracting me strongly again. Yet knowing how something like that can collapse, we have to see whether or not it would be an illusion. Anyway, I have enough to do for the time being. I now have the space again to be able to work with a model. And as to how long it will last, there’s no telling. Well, regards — the Salon will certainly give you plenty to do, but at the same time also be an interesting time. Thanks again for what you sent, which I really needed because of this change, by the way. I hope you’ll be able to agree with it when you see how I’ve fitted it out. Adieu, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b402 V/19My dear Theo, As you can imagine, we’ve made several trips together to the weavers and all sorts of fine things outdoors. He was very taken with the scenery here, which is also beginning to appeal to me more and more. Since I made them — even though that’s a relatively short time ago — I’ve got a little out of that way of doing it. I’ve done nothing but paint recently. And I’m curious as to whether you’ll see anything in it when you come. You’ll see that I’ll very definitely keep it up, and that what was in those watercolours has been strengthened quite a lot in what I’ve painted since. I’m very pleased with the new studio; it’s roomier and good and dry. I hope to hear from you soon, I’ve had rather a lot of expenses because of the new studio. Regards, write soon, and believe me, with a handshake Yours truly, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b403 V/19My dear Theo, I still often think about your pleasant visit, which I hope will presently be repeated for a rather longer time. Since you were here I’ve been working quite hard on a woman spinning, a little scratch of which I send you herewith. Speaking of ‘snot colours’, to my mind one shouldn’t consider the colours in a painting in isolation — if, for instance, a snot colour is placed against strong tones of brownish red, of dark blue or of olive green — it can express the very tender and fresh green of a meadow or a little wheatfield. Those at home will also write to you soon, and thank your for your letter. And the same with blue, and the same with yellow likewise. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b404 V/1962My dear Theo, If one says what one says clearly, though, this isn’t enough, strictly speaking. It has bothered me FOR A LONG TIME, Theo, that some of the painters nowadays are taking from us the bistre and the bitumen with which, after all, so many magnificent things were painted, which — properly used, make the coloration lush and tender and generous, and at the same time so dignified. And have such highly remarkable and individual qualities. One should know this sort of thing, theoretically too, be it as a practitioner when painting or as an expert talking about colour. Well — adieu, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b405 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Many thanks for your letter and 200 francs enclosed. But besides, since it completely slipped my mind, I don’t have a single watercolour in hand and would have to start new ones in a hurry, if it’s not already too late for this year. And when I tell you that I’m just now absorbed in two new large studies of weavers’ interiors, you’ll understand that I’m not in the mood for it. Particularly since it could involve all sorts of unpleasantnesses were I to apply again to the gentlemen in The Hague. But for want of a good model I haven’t yet started on what has most struck me in nature these last few days. At present the half-ripe wheatfields have a dark, golden blond tone, ruddy or golden bronze. This is brought out to maximum effect by opposition with the broken cobalt tone of the sky. And it preoccupies me greatly. For this is very precise work, and one isn’t at liberty to depart from the colours of the costume, since the effect lies in the analogy of the broken indigo tone and the broken cobalt tone, heightened by the mysterious elements of orange in the ruddy bronze of the wheat. But if the summer is the opposition of blues against an element of orange in the golden bronze of the wheat, this way one could paint a painting in each of the contrasts of the complementary colours (red and green, blue and orange, yellow and violet, white and black) that really expressed the mood of the seasons. Regards, and thanks again for your letter and the enclosure. Believe me Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b406 V/19My dear Theo, Nature is certainly pure here — I’m still very pleased with the studio, too.  We must visit some farms and weavers together when you come. Well, I write in some haste because I’m hard at work. I work a good deal early in the morning or in the evening, and then sometimes everything is so inexpressibly beautiful. Regards, believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b407 V/19My dear Theo, Which some present-day English artists have started to make, after having learned to see and paint from the French. Last week I was in the fields every day during the wheat harvest — of which I’ve made a composition. I’m really looking forward to your arrival. I’m still pleased to be here — I miss some things from time to time, but the work absorbs me enough. When you come here you’ll find all the peasants busy ploughing — and sowing spurrey — or — it will just be coming to an end then. I’ve seen magnificent sunsets over the stubble fields. Goodbye for now. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b408 V/19My dear Theo, And it will be my endeavour to find something to replace that, too, and eventually I’ll succeed. Regards. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b388 V/19My dear Theo, Adieu, Vincent Do you remember that first Mme Bovary? Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b409 V/19My dear Theo, Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b410 V/19My dear Theo, Yours truly, Vincent It’s true that for my part I’ve now experienced great sadness in two cases, sadness of a very different character. So be it — but you’ll see that your own theory in this respect doesn’t always produce the results that one would say it promises to produce. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b411 a-b V/19My dear Theo, So take the 1848 period.  Think about this if you will — for I don’t believe that you can contradict very much of it; all I can say is that I believe this is pretty much how it is. I’ve now realized that while I used to hope that you’d turn out differently and we’d be on the same side, it has been decided that we’ve ended up in opposing camps. And you — for your part, perhaps hoped that I’d change to the extent that we’d have fetched up together on the side where you are now. But you see I have no intention of that. I have to shoot in your direction — I’ll try not to hit you, though. You have to shoot in my direction — do the same. Anyway, it was 48 then, it’s 84 now. The mill is there no longer, the wind is still there. However, try to know for yourself where you actually are, as I try to know it for myself. Regards. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b413 a V/1962 It remains odd that Van Gogh used the word ‘soon’ in association with the upcoming exhibition of Delacroix’s work, since it was not due to open until March 188My dear Theo, I was planning to send them to a few illustrated magazines to see if I could get work, or at least become known. But I’ve decided against it, since the photographer only produces prints that reflect none, or at least far too little of the original chiaroscuro, moreover retouches a great deal and badly, and even so still often leaves things dark that are light in the painting and vice versa. I’ve worked really hard recently; I believe, in conjunction with other agitation, even overworked. At least I’m in a sad mood, and all these things have affected me to such an extent that I have many days when I’m relatively powerless. I can’t eat and I can’t sleep, that’s to say not enough, and that makes one weak. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent The painting of the sower is the same size as the woman spinning; the colour of the soil is neutral but slightly pink, light green further away. The man’s smock is blue and the trousers brown. The gaiters dirty linen. I fancy that the head shows up against the sky better in the painting than in the photograph. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b414 a-b, e V/1962 Date of postmark: Tuesday, 30 September 188My dear Theo, Thanks for your letter, thanks for the enclosure. Now listen here. I know it’s difficult, I know that I don’t know enough about you, I know that I may perhaps be mistaken. But anyway — just read your Mouret again. Yours truly, Vincent ‘Are you enjoying yourself?’ Mouret seemed not to understand immediately. But, when he recalled their old conversations about empty foolishness and the pointless torment of life, he replied: ‘No doubt — never have I lived so much... Ah! old chap — don’t mock! Those are the shortest hours in which one dies of suffering! Just a way of deadening oneself — the other muttered. Let them talk, those cold theologians. Were a few Mourets to emerge, who bought and sold other than according to the old routine, good, then there would be more and more work to be done. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b412 a-c V/1962 (sheets 1, 2, 3) and b413 b V/1962 (sheet 4) Apparently he gives his models a drink when he’s out in the fields with them, and he said himself that he therefore occasionally has one too. That could be the case. According to what V. says, he sometimes takes a drink in the evening on the Dr’s advice because he has such sleepless nights. That remedy seems very unsuitable to us. But the business with Margot continues to occupy him very much and he is rather depressed at the moment. We are doing our best to restore him to calm, which is the most important thing. But his outlook on life and his ways are so different from ours, that it’s questionable whether living together in the same place can continue in the long run. However we don’t want a real separation and are willing to tolerate and attempt everything to the utmost, if only he could become a bit normal. We do expect something to come of that in time. V. just received your registered letter. He told us that you advised him to do everything he could not to make our staying here impossible. We are hoping for the best. Meanwhile he has noticed that we could leave here if we want to; the day before yesterday I received a call to go to Baardwijk, a village in the Langstraat, close to Waalwijk ... We have so much that is good here that it would be difficult for us to leave. Only if our relations with people were to become difficult because of circumstances, then it could come to it. There’s risk enough of that at the moment’ (FR b2257). Mr van Gogh intended to discuss this call to the village of Baardwijk (North Brabant), on Tuesday, 8 OctobeMy dear Theo, You know well enough that your criticism, at least over the last 1 1/2  years, appears to me to be just a sort of vitriol. Don’t think that I don’t know that against that vitriol one must furnish oneself with a sort of hide that it can’t easily penetrate, and that if one is hardened to it, it doesn’t trouble one much — so — what do I care? I also believe, moreover, that you mean well. So what more do you want? The former, that it produces a poor return for you, saddens me more than the latter, that it also produces a poor return for me. It can get better, you’ll say — yes, but then not only I, but also you, will have to change a great deal. I wanted to let you know that in the winter, perhaps as early as next month, I’m going away from here for a while — I’ve thought about Antwerp — I’ve thought about The Hague. But in the last few days I’ve thought of something that’s possibly even better. This is by no means the easiest view of things, and anyone who says — oh, it must all come naturally — is making light of it. Particularly when, after all, the sum isn’t such that receiving it or not makes a great deal of difference. If I get by, perhaps I’ll do it precisely by working more cheaply than others and by making it easier for the art lovers. It’s neither the best paintings nor the best people — in which there are no errors or bias. In short, there is what emanates from revolutionary and what emanates from anti-revolutionary principles. Now I ask you whether you yourself haven’t often noted that the policy of hovering between the old and the new isn’t tenable. Just think about that. Sooner or later it ends with one openly standing either on the right or on the left. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b415 a-b V/19My dear Theo, It’s extraordinarily beautiful here at the moment with the autumnal effects. In a fortnight we’ll have the real fall of the leaves — when everything that’s on the trees falls in a few days. And perhaps you’re right that I should just find a way for my work myself, and become my own dealer. Anyway. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b416 V/1962My dear Theo, At the end of the road a peasant cottage, and the blue sky above it between the autumn leaves. Because of one thing and another I discussed with him, it may well be that I prefer to stay here and carry on working here rather than go somewhere else. As a result of his visit I’ve again got new ideas for my own work, and have so many things in my head which I’d like to make that, after all, I can’t easily postpone getting on with them right away. Well — as to that — I’ll get new acquaintances before too long in any event. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b417 V/19My dear Theo, I received your letter, and I thank you for it and for the enclosure. When you write that you’re again facing your bad half year — for it lasts a  1/2  year, I think — it isn’t exactly pleasant news for you to write nor for me to receive. However, we must try to do something about it to ensure that things go better for both of us. You always contradict yourself — the above-mentioned passage (*) in your letter is immediately followed by the question as to whether I could perhaps give you some new principles about the issue of reforming the trade. Help me to get going and earn money, not only by sending money but also through your influence and more cooperation and a better sort of friendship. I say again, back the approach I’ve made, for instance, for it should have been made sooner with support on your part. Do it generously and resolutely, not hesitating or being non-committal when it comes to the point. Yours truly, Vincent That’s what I asked — nothing else, and that’s all I need. They mustn’t be involved in the financial side at all. If I can’t save up for it myself, you’ll have to make the utmost effort to send me an extra 100 francs, because I won’t be going for long — Then — after that — I’ll again have a few tips for improving my work here and making progress with it. And again have a pied-à-terre with a good, sound painter. And then I guarantee that something will soon happen — either I’ll exhibit or I’ll sell. And so, courage! But let’s go onward together and hammer away at it together until we’ve achieved it. Onward — and it doesn’t matter a damn if it fails — if it fails, then do it again. Working capital that could generate very good interest after a few years, then anyway, 20% to start with, for example. And could be paid back later. So that the money from you, say we call it 5,000 francs at a pinch, is my working capital. Now that result — 20% interest a year on 5,000 francs — I’d like you to help me get it. These are facts and figures, and you must see to it that you get your confidence and energy back in this matter. And then, naturally, business marks time and comes to a standstill. Anyway. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b418 a-c V/1962 Now that Van Rappard has left and his visit has inspired Vincent with new plans, he again addresses himself wholly and at length to Theo. The money he received must be the allowance for November; we have therefore dated the letter on or about Sunday, 2 November 188My dear Theo, I don’t regret that approach. But they’ve refused to have anything to do with it — ‘very definitely’ refused. This doesn’t discourage me. I regard it as something like sending a painting to an exhibition and having it rejected. One has to encounter opposition at first, or even several times. Which they don’t see yet. So much on my part to you. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b419 a-b V/1962 The letter is unsigned, so it may be incompletMy dear Theo, I’ll become stronger in the very struggle itself, and learn more through criticism, through unwillingness and even resistance, than through resignation. The extra I’m asking for I’m not asking for all at once — but here’s how. Try to send 20 francs extra around 20 Nov. — 1 December the usual, around 20 December another 20 francs extra, and the same in January. Then I’m covered for the ends of those months and won’t have to stop for days when the work demands that I don’t lose a moment. Regards. Try to send at least 20 francs by 20 Nov. to cover the end of this month. With a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b420 a-b V/19My dear Theo, The decision wasn’t a matter of indifference to me — since I wouldn’t have gone with them to H. in any case, and would either have stayed here in my studio — or would have left for Antwerp. Now — as far as I can see, the best thing for me is simply to carry on as things are — and stay here. It has truly not been going too badly for me lately. It’s true that I can’t make anything financially from my work here — but I’m making really good friends here — and I believe they’ll become even better. But for my part, I also have to do something to keep on good terms with them. Now, as to what I asked you about covering the end of this month if possible by sending me 20 francs extra, I wish you could do that. And I’ll give it back to you with my work. That’s all I can say about it. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b423 V/19Dear brother, Thanks for your letter and the money. To business, though — have you ever realized that I presently have more than two guilders in expenses daily — reckon 1 for the model, 1 for canvas, paint — it can’t come out any cheaper. What is not can yet come, you say, regarding my work — and I, regarding the perception of something other than a fata Morgana in your saying ‘later we’ll etc. — (see above)’: Today — it’s a fata Morgana to me and I wish, in any event, to try Antwerp. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b422 V/19My dear Theo, And bearing in mind that we must see to it that we avoid putting a spoke in each other’s wheels, I will, as I said, increasingly try to find other contacts or connections in Eindhoven, in Antwerp, in short, wherever I can. I’m still in two minds as to what I should try to do — but I’ll most probably not stay here after all — and then where to go will be the question. I don’t think that you’ll approve of my coming to Paris — but what can I do about it? You flatly refuse to look after my interests — very well — but I can’t just leave it at that. I wouldn’t have thought of it if you had written less decidedly that it was beneath you, but now — well, now — I can take no notice of you. Don’t you find it very understandable that, when I hear you say that you can’t do anything with my work for the next few years, I then get the slight sense that, if you want to remain high and mighty on this point, there’s a rather odd contradiction if — precisely because I’m not selling, however hard I work — I’m forced to say, Theo, I’m 25 guilders short, couldn’t you let me have a bit extra, then this proves not to be possible. But one may not say, I can’t manage on my money. Except to the extent that if you’re doing it deliberately to get rid of me, you’re truly well on the way to achieving that goal. In the past you know that I often specifically asked you that we should keep up the relationship — now I could no longer urge it in the same way. Again, I work too hard for me to have to remain for much longer in a dependent position which degenerates too much into patronage, while when I write about it in a businesslike way I don’t even get an answer. No — old chap — seeing something in it that I may continue to regard as lasting is no longer reconcilable with my sense of honour, of justice. So — taking rooms in Eindhoven would be sheer nonsense — and I can’t even think about it. A room in Antwerp later on, all right — that is indeed my intention — but firstly I don’t have any money for it now, and secondly I still want to paint a fairly large number of heads first — with which I’ll make progress — to the extent that it’s at all possible for me to pay the models. Which in the circumstances, as you say, things don’t exactly foster. I can’t do any silly things just like that in the circumstances, and cook my own goose by breaking off here at a moment that doesn’t lend itself to it — just because you’re in a mistrustful period. But be aware of this, that if this mistrustful period endures with you and seems about to take root — even if I don’t do any silly things just like that — I’m nonetheless seriously thinking of seeing to it that we can part in peace and without damage to you or me. It’s too much for me all at once, losing you in this respect, and having to pay for my keep again as well. Gradually, though, I’ll see to it that I find another resource of my own accord. Vincent I must object to an underlined section in your letter — which I copy. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b424 a-b V/1962 (sheets 1, 3); b412 d V/1962 (sheet 2) and b387 a V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, One doesn’t always have the words to lay all one’s cards on the table, but — towards you — I’m so determined — (I don’t care whether you’re mistrustful or not) — to speak out completely frankly — that with some reflection I’ve perhaps found clearer words for what I already made you feel. But — you had a certain struggle with your conscience on that point which you would prefer to avoid. So you don’t think about it, and you’re not exactly very kind if I raise it, that point in question. In all events, you think me foolish in these matters, and always dismiss them. This is your drawback — in this respect I find you very miserable — but your good side is your reliability with the money. Yours truly, Vincent Part — but in peace — without forcing it too much. Try to see to it that I don’t have to lose any time, that I can readily go on painting, and I’ll go on until I’m worth so much that people give me work in Antwerp in return for board and paint. The road in this respect is fairly well marked, I believe. Money — yes. But what good is it to me if I have to do without the rest? It remains sterile because of it, your money, because it’s not used the way I’ve always told you — a labourer’s household if need be, but if one doesn’t make sure that one has a home of one’s own, art doesn’t thrive. And for my part — I told you really quite plainly enough back in my salad days, if I couldn’t get a fine woman I’d take a common one, better a common one than none. I know plenty of people who argue the exact opposite, and are as frightened of ‘children’ as I am of ‘no children’. And consequently I’m not that afraid of the future because I know how and why I acted in the past. And because I know that there are others who feel the same as I feel. But you know my motives — if I go on, you would become Pa II in my life and, although I know you mean well — you don’t understand me at all, and nothing could come of it. I dare say — that if you were just to analyze your own feelings rather more accurately — what you call ‘mistrust’ — could actually have been something very different.

I don’t need much, 20 francs or 30 francs will go a long way towards covering it. Regards — if you have borrowed or can borrow, help me with this. Since I didn’t want my entire paint bill at the end of the year, I’ve already paid part of it off this month, as I said. But that the work should be delayed by it is something I can’t tolerate. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b427 V/19My dear Theo, I may perhaps do them in watercolour too, later on. But paint them first. Now — in this age — whether the public is wiser — I don’t know — but I do know this — that it’s absolutely not superfluous to be serious in what one wants and what one does. Had I not done that, I would have had to muddle along for perhaps another 3 years before I had finally swallowed the bitter pill of colour and tone, also simply because of the expense. And in the utmost seriousness, once again — can’t you find some way of helping me with 20 francs, say, to cover that little end? It’s my time that will otherwise not be sufficiently occupied that really pains me. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b428 V/1962 In his final remark Van Gogh is referring to the characteristic types that are depicted in these workMy dear Theo, Only, the figure always stands somewhere, and one sometimes can’t help putting in the surroundings, their being indispensable. I do know why I’m making them, though, and to what end in general. From which I draw the conclusion that Dante’s expression, however sad and melancholy, is essentially an expression of something infinitely good and tender. I therefore can’t imagine Satan or Mephistopheles as Dantean at all. So all the more reason why I’m curious to see what it looks like in the painting. Best wishes for the New Year. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b429 V/19My dear Theo, I’ve hardly ever begun a year that had a gloomier aspect in a gloomier mood, and so I don’t expect a future of success, but — a future of struggle. It’s dismal outdoors — the fields a marble of clods of black earth and some snow, usually a few days of fog and mud in between — the red sun in the evening and in the morning — crows, shrivelled grass and withered, rotting vegetation, black bushes, and the branches of the poplars and willows vicious as wire against the dismal sky. This, I see it in passing, and it’s quite in harmony with the interiors, very gloomy in these dark winter days. It’s also in harmony with the physiognomies of peasants and weavers. So not only wages low, but work fairly scarce. There’s consequently often something harried and restless in these people. But they look as little cheerful as the cab-horses or the sheep that are transported by steamer to England. Regards — I hope you’ll be able to send; I have less than a guilder left and must have a model for several more hours today. So tomorrow I’ll be stuck again, but possibly your letter will come. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b430 V/1962 The annual profits payment was worked out after the inventory was compiled in January of the following year, and then paid out by the head office. For 1884 Theo was entitled to an annual share of the profits worth 6,943.65 francs; in total he had earned an average of 912 francs a month in 1884 (FR b2123). See also Account book 2002, pp. 15-16. We do not know who is meant by ‘Someone who works in electricityMy dear Theo, You would do me a very great favour if you could manage to get hold of 24 October 1884 I’m still working on various heads and — hands — I’ve also drawn some more, perhaps you’ll see something in them — then again, perhaps not — what can I do about it? Again — I know no other way. In short — decide that sort of thing for yourself. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b431 V/19My dear Theo, I’m really waiting for the money; I had hoped it might have been possible for you to send it a few days earlier. I’ve written to you at length about how my intention of painting 50 or so heads means that I have to incur even more expenses than usual. And since you yourself gave cause by writing that you were suspicious of me, I’m put out when I think that it’s probably more due to this than to anything else that I’m sometimes embarrassed. I wouldn’t mind that I don’t sell, if the work itself could carry on at full speed anyway. Still, I do what I can, and I’m making progress with it after all.  When — you’ll have to decide that for yourself — but I just warn you that the very worst misunderstandings come about because of suspicion. For my part, I’m sometimes upset that your character seems to have set fast in a form which I believe could cause you disquiet later. But what’s the use of talking about it? What I mean is a family ailment, it seems to me. I always imagine that in Zundert and for a few years afterwards there was generally a better atmosphere at home. Since then, I don’t feel it’s got any better. These days —  But what I don’t know is whether that former — that it was better in Zundert — is just my imagination — it could well be. Yours truly, Vincent Since this summer I can’t help always visualizing you with your lorgnette with dark lenses. This doesn’t change a person very much, you’ll say. Maybe so — but my impression is that you have perhaps, in a sense other than the literal one, acquired dark glasses in what you think and do. Suspicion, for instance. Now, though, you’re making a mistake if for your part you can’t understand that your suspicion of me is downright inappropriate. Most certainly I think differently, I feel differently, I act differently. But in its context it has its reason for being. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b425 V/1962 In his previous letter (of about 26 January) Van Gogh asked Theo to send the money for February a few days early. He now notes to his regret that Theo has not been able to accede to that request. This letter must therefore have been written on Friday, 30 January 188My dear Theo, I have a great deal to say about your calling my last letter ‘particularly unpleasant’. With this specially added, ‘that you are suspicious’. Well, if it had only been the former, I probably wouldn’t have given it any more attention. That addition of your suspicion, though, that was a bit too much for me, and I repeatedly asked you to take it back or to explain it, because I don’t allow something like that to be said without asking for enlightenment. And in my last letter I compared suspicion in general with a dark glass one looks through. And said that the nastiest misunderstandings arise because of it. And that’s true. When you ask me in your letter how it is that you never hear me say, ‘I’d like to be thus or so’ — is — because I believe that those who make the greatest parade of ‘I’d like to be thus or so’ do the least to improve themselves. Those who say it, usually don’t do it. So that’s the reason — and since I take pains to improve my work, I don’t have to keep lapsing into lamentations. And — after all — take note that as far as that suspicion is concerned and what I replied to it, it isn’t so much because I won’t allow you or others, if need be, to think of me exactly as you will, but I’ve warned you that it would give you little satisfaction if your character were to set in that mould. And therefore don’t despair. But now it’s wretched for both of us. And for me the work is expensive; I have to paint a lot and I constantly need a model for it; just all the more reason why, at a time when the work is difficult and exacting, and at the same time thankless, it’s quite wretched to get suspicion for it. Never mind, it’s a period I have to go through, and one doesn’t paint for one’s comfort. Thanks for what you sent. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b426 V/19My dear Theo, With the result that I see a chance, before long I hope, of doing it very differently. I think that it will help me with the figure in general. Today I had a white and black one, against the flesh colour. The people here instinctively wear the most beautiful blue that I’ve ever seen. It’s coarse linen that they weave themselves, warp black, weft blue, which creates a black and blue striped pattern. When it’s faded and slightly discoloured by wind and weather, it’s an infinitely calm, subtle shade that specifically brings out the flesh colours. In short, blue enough to react with all the colours in which there are hidden orange elements, and faded enough not to clash. Regards, and thanks again for the illustrations. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b432 V/19My dear Theo, This in the first place — and then further that if I’d known it 6 weeks earlier, I would have tried to send you something for this purpose. So you’ll receive heads of an old and a young woman, and probably more than one of these two models. Given what you write of your feelings about various conceptions of heads, I think that these, which come straight out of a cottage with a moss-grown thatched roof, won’t appear to you to be absolutely inappropriate, although they’re studies and nothing else. If I’d known 6 weeks earlier, I would have made a woman spinning or spooling yarn — full length — of them. How his little figures in that composition are felt and wanted. Thanks again for it. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b433 V/1962My dear Theo, I have a few of the heads I promised you ready, but not completely dry yet. But as I already wrote, they were painted in a dark cottage and they are — studies — in the true meaning of the word. I had already made a start on sending you study drawings in the past. Not so much in themselves as in conjunction with other studies. And after all, it’s difficult to say where study stops and painting begins. Namely figures against the light from a window. Still, I think I’ve learned a few things from it. Regards, I didn’t want to put off writing again any longer. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b434 V/19Original telegram Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b2272 V/1962 Date of postmark: Friday, 27 March 1885. Received: 6.00 hours. It is striking that this telegram does not say who has died. This is probably why Vincent sent the other telegrams to Theo’s workplaces – these two explicitly state that it was their father. Telegram.

It can do no harm, though, that he’s been to the studio. I don’t mind starting a new still life of those honesty heads and dry leaves against blue either, because he said something about that too. Of course I intend to keep working hard, but it’s very necessary for me to square my paint bill as soon as possible. Every other year, I’ve been able to get square at about this time and buy myself some new equipment. And this year I’ve painted so much the last few months that I actually need it more. There are about 3 months, let’s say, between now and the time you come back here in the summer. But I didn’t have it easy in those months, I can tell you that. And could serve as a pendant to it. If you mount these two on gilded Bristol they might perhaps look good in the gold, do better than by themselves. Regards, with a handshake, and still thinking often of your visit Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b435 V/19My dear Theo, It will make things even more difficult for me. But consequently I have no choice — with a beginning like that, one has to take steps to prevent all that sort of thing in the future. So I’m absolutely decided. And I think it by no means unlikely that I’ll stay here for the rest of my life, too. After all, I desire nothing other than to live deep in the country and to paint peasant life. All the same, it will still take me a great deal of effort before I imprint my paintings in people’s heads. Meanwhile, I have no intention whatsoever of allowing myself to be discouraged. I was thinking today that they really were almighty brave fellows, those pioneers. Art lovers like this are sometimes struck by sincerity, and not put off by what deters others. I know how I used to walk round the city for hours, looking in the shop windows, to see some little view of the country somewhere, no matter what. We’re now at the beginning of letting people see; I believe absolutely and utterly that little by little we’ll find a few people for it. Circumstances compel us, and gradually we’ll also be able to show better things. Suppose that you don’t feel you’re in a position to give me the extra I received in spring and summer in other years, and which, by the way, I can’t do without. If I go to live in the studio, I’ll inevitably have to have a cupboard built, for instance, because at present I have nowhere at all to store things, and I’ll also improve the light. To me, moving would be as bad as a fire — and anyway I think that we’ll stay on top of things with perseverance and effort. I think I’ll start painting in watercolour regularly in the evenings — as soon as I’m living in the studio — it can’t really be done in the living room here at home. Until then, I’ll go on working from the model in the evenings too. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b436 a-b V/1962 (sheets 1, My dear Theo, It has surprised me a little not to have received even a single word from you. You’ll say you’ve been too busy to think about it — and I can very well understand that. It’s already late — but I wanted to tell you once more that I whole-heartedly hope that from now on the correspondence will again become livelier than it has been recently.  I’ve just come home from there — and have worked on it further by lamplight — although this time I started it in daylight.  But that’s something I certainly won’t be able to do like that for the time being. At the point where I now am, though, I see a chance of giving a felt impression of what I see. What I’d like to advise now is the following: don’t let the time slip by — let me work as much as is in any way possible — and keep all the studies from now on yourself. I’d rather not sign any of them yet, though, because I wouldn’t like to have them circulating like paintings, so that one would have to buy them back later should one make something of a name. I mean to go out regularly in the mornings and just tackle whatever I see the people doing in the fields or at home. As I do now anyway. There are people, aren’t there, who support painters during the time when they aren’t yet earning — very well. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b437 V/1962, d281 V/1971 and d282 V/19My dear Theo, I haven’t been able to work it up as far as had been my intention. I painted 3 days continuously from early till late, and by Saturday evening the paint started to get into a state that didn’t allow further work. Unless it’s completely dry first. But that’s not necessary, now — although I can tell you I know for sure the year will be very grim. So what I hope not to forget is that — ‘it’s a question of going around in clogs’, that is of being content as regards food, drink, clothes, sleep, with what the peasants are content with. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b438 V/1962 (sheet 1), present whereabouts unknown (sheet 2) Further on he reformulated this idea: ‘Millet was of his time. A peasant dedicated to hard work on the land, he constantly had in his heart compassion and pity for the rural poor. He was neither a socialist nor an ideologue, and yet, like all profound thinkers who love humanity, he suffered at the sufferings of others, and he needed to express them. To do that, he had only to paint the real peasant at work’ (Millet était de son temps. Paysan voué aux durs travaux de la terre, il avait sans cesse au coeur la compassion, la pitié pour les misérables des campagnes. Il n’était ni socialiste ni idéologue, et pourtant, comme tous les penseurs profonds et aimant l’humanité, il souffrait des souffrances des autres, et il avait besoin de les exprimer. Pour cela, il n’avait qu’à peindre le vrai paysan à son travail). Sensier 1881, pp. 180-18My dear Theo, I’m not much bothered about it, anyway, because I want to learn to make lithographs myself so as to be independent. If I work the sketch up into a painting, I’ll also make a new lithograph of it, and such that the figures — which are now reversed, I’m sorry to say — come right again. Yours truly, Vincent Because if one now brings together similar colours in the pure state, but with differing degrees of energy, for example, dark blue and light blue, one will obtain a different effect, in which there will be a contrast by virtue of the difference in intensity, and harmony by virtue of the similarity. Lastly, if two similar colours are juxtaposed, one in the pure state, the other broken — for example, pure blue with grey blue, the result will be another sort of contrast which will be tempered by the analogy between them. One can thus see that there exist several ways, different from each other, but equally infallible, of strengthening, supporting, attenuating or neutralizing the effect of a colour, and they involve working on what’s next to it — by touching what isn’t the colour itself. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b439 a-bV/19My dear Theo, And anyway, what I write to him, I also say to you. Moving is causing me some considerable concern these days, because it’s never straightforward. All the same, it will have to happen, if not now then later, anyway, and in the long run it’s better to be in one’s own place, that’s for sure. To my mind, one hears people in the art trade speak of them so vaguely and arbitrarily. And among the painters themselves, too, for that matter. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b440 V/1962 Vincent sent Theo several lithographs with this letter and asked him to give them to Portier. On 22 April 1885 Theo wrote to his mother from Paris: ‘Would you be so good as to tell Vincent that I just received his lithographs and his letter, that I will take them to Mr Portier tomorrow’ (FR b900). The present letter must therefore have been written on Tuesday, 21 April 1885.My dear Theo, Just wanted to tell you that I’m hard at work on the potato eaters. It is felt, in the sense of being studied on a large and on a small scale at the same time, but above all largely imagined and broadly conceived too. I sincerely hope that you’ll keep watching out for new months in the series. But you know yourself how many times I’ve painted the heads! I shan’t send it unless I hear further from you, and anyway it’s not even finished yet. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b441 V/19My dear Theo, A peasant girl is more beautiful than a lady — to my mind — in her dusty and patched blue skirt and jacket, which have acquired the most delicate nuances from weather, wind and sun. But — if she puts — a lady’s costume on, then the genuineness is lost. A peasant in his suit of fustian in the fields is finer than when he goes to church on Sundays in a sort of gentleman’s coat. No — one must paint the peasants as if one were one of them, as feeling, thinking as they do themselves. As not being able to be other than one is. I so often think that the peasants are a world in themselves, so much better in many respects than the civilized world. Not in all respects, because what do they know of art and many other things? I do still have a few smaller studies — you can imagine, though, that I’ve been kept so busy with the larger one that I’ve been able to do little else besides that. I believe that the potato eaters will come off — the last days are always hazardous for a painting, as you know, because one can’t touch it with a large brush when it isn’t completely dry without a great risk of spoiling it. And the changes have to be made very coolly and calmly with a small brush. This is why I simply took it away and said to my friend that he just had to make sure that I didn’t spoil it in that way, and that I’d come do those small things at his place. You’ll see that it has originality. Regards — I’m sorry it wasn’t ready for today — again wishing you health and serenity, believe me, with a handshake Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b442 a-b V/1962 Vincent sends Theo his best wishes for his birthday on 1 May, so we have dated the letter Thursday, 30 April 188My dear Theo,  I did paint them that way at the beginning of the painting — some yellow ochre, red ochre and white, for example. I can make a smaller version of it or a drawing, though, if you would rather have that, for I feel the thing in such a way that I can literally dream it. So that the two women and the interior were almost exactly the same colour as dark green soap. But the figure of the man on the left was just lit by light coming in from a door further along. Thus head and hands became the colour of, say, a 10-centime piece, that is, dull copper. And his smock the most delicate faded blue possible, where the light caught it. With a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b443 V/1962My dear Theo, I’m dropping you a quick line before I send off the little crate. I’m sending it carriage paid (Antwerp) (or right through if possible) to your address, rue de Laval. Should this be the case, then just look at it for a while. For they are masterpieces that one gets for 50 centimes this way. How on earth is it that the illustrated magazines aren’t better! Life in every little scratch. It’s absolutely not my intention to raise the question as if I myself knew it all. I hear and see so little, or nothing, so I’m not in a position to test this against the paintings themselves and see what they reveal about this question. But working and seeking myself, and thinking about it in front of nature, as I’ve written to you before, this question won’t leave me in peace. I’m in the middle of moving. Thanks again for what you sent, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b444 a-b V/1962My dear Theo, If not, I’d like to know for later consignments. If it was correct, it cost me not quite 2 guilders, which I believe works out cheaper than if one calculates the carriage in Paris, and we can try it again sometime, with fairly large dimensions too.  Because for the time being we can use the money better for making new ones. And only start framing them when we’ve got a few together. It wasn’t completely dry when I packed it, but I thought it couldn’t really be damaged any more. I would like to have done much more to it, though, but because of the sinking in and since it had already been lifted more than once, I could see that I had to stop. And start again on something else. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b445 V/196My dear Theo, Many thanks for your letter and for the 50 francs enclosed, which was very welcome to me this month in particular, what with the move. I think that I’ll save a very great deal of time in the long run by living in the studio, since I’ll be able to get started first thing in the morning, for instance, whereas the way it was at home I couldn’t do anything. If you want, though, you can have the one of the sale. One thing and another was the reason I didn’t send you confirmation of the receipt of your letter before. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent You’ve seen much more than I have — and I wish that I’d seen what you’ve seen and are still looking at every day. But perhaps seeing a great deal is precisely what makes it difficult to reflect. Anyway. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b446 a-b V/1962    My dear Theo, If all goes well — if I earn rather more so that I can travel more — well then I’ll also, I hope, paint the miners’ heads sometime. However, I’ll keep working until I’m absolutely and utterly sure of my case — such that I’m working even faster than now and will also be able to bring home 30 or so studies in the space of a month, say. I don’t know whether we’ll earn money, but if it’s just enough to work a tremendous amount then I’m content; doing what one wants is what matters. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b447 V/19My dear Theo, among the latter you’ll find a head that I couldn’t help painting after reading Germinal. ‘Did I tell you how she died? Who do you mean? My wife, over there in Russia. Etienne made a vague gesture, surprised at the trembling of the voice, at that need to confide, in this usually impassive youth with his stoical detachment from others and from himself. He knew only that the wife was a mistress, and that she had been hanged in Moscow. Souvarine went on: on the last day, in the square, I was there... It was raining — the bunglers were losing their nerve, put off by the torrential rain. They had taken 20 minutes to hang 4 other people. She was standing waiting. She couldn’t see me, she was looking for me in the crowd. I stood up on a stone bollard and she saw me, and we did not take our eyes off one another again. For you see, they are two dwellings and the chimney is double. One sees that here a lot, by the way. I don’t have time, otherwise I’d like to say a very great deal about Germinal, which I think splendid. But when you see him, just tell him frankly that my idea is — if, after the sympathy which he expressed concerning my work, I do my utmost to send work and thus stick to my guns — I’m certainly counting on his persevering in showing my work. Tell him that my idea is that in the long run a part of the public in Paris won’t be fooled by convention, however seductive, but on the contrary that that which still has in it the most dust from the cottages or from the field will, I don’t know how or why myself, find a few very loyal friends. That he must therefore not lose heart too soon, because you and I combined won’t take it amiss of him should it not succeed for a longer or shorter time, but that he must just go on showing. And that I’ll go on sending. Yours truly, Vincent I know that you wrote ‘he is perhaps more of an enthusiast than a salesman, which is perhaps better’. I can see that you’re doing your best to reconcile us, but my dear chap, I really don’t wish her any harm, and I really don’t do them any harm. Only I don’t want to exert any influence on them, since firstly they don’t understand themselves, but secondly don’t want to understand either. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b448 V/1962 and b446 c V/19My dear Theo, What I further assert is that one does both others and especially oneself too a disservice by being bored. In spite of many wise lessons, I’ve never seriously granted that being bored ‘for one’s own good’ can have its good, practical side. Now a MASS of people have reformed themselves at the age of about 30 and changed very considerably. You don’t have to take any notice of this or reply to it — I say it to you just to express my idea frankly, not to start futile exchanges of words. Anyway — I’ll hear sometime whether you’ve received the little crate and whether you find anything in it. Yours truly, Vincent Oh — one mustn’t doubt — anyone who paints the peasants nowadays and has his heart in his work, he wins — at least a part, and not the worst although it’s not the largest — of the public. This doesn’t alter the fact that my end or second half of the month — can still work out remarkably meagre. But the same happens to the peasant lads too, and — they still have fun. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b449 a-b V/19My dear Theo,  I’m very busy with the figure drawings; however I’ll have to make 100 or so before I paint them, since that will save me time and money. From time to time I can become dispirited that it will always just stay the same, selling nothing. Still, I carry on and steel myself against it. Others have borne it, too. Yours truly, Vincent So when I feel discouragement it’s only in passing. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b450 V/1962 We do not know whether Serret was a dealer as well as an artist – his name does not appear in Goupil’s sales ledgerMy dear Theo, Thanks for your letter and the enclosure, which is exactly what I meant and enables me to work at the end of the month just as at the beginning of the month. It’s precisely because I tried it first in The Hague, that’s to say my own country, that I have every right and reason to forget all that unpleasantness and to think of something else outside my own country. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b451 V/19My dear Theo, So you see: that they start to regard every effect against a strong and coloured light, every shadow, as heresy — that they never seem to go for a walk very early in the morning, or in the evening at sunset, that they don’t want to see anything but midday light or gaslight, and that has to be electric! Perhaps you see nothing in this but my constant contrariness. I’m working hard on figure drawings every day. I must have at least a hundred, though — or even more, before I can stop again. I’m trying to find something different from my old drawings, and to find the character of the peasants — especially those from round here. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b452 V/19My dear Theo, We’ll — inevitably talk about these things again sometime. I’ve got some more figures. I’m sorry about what you write about the money, that you’ll be short yourself. Painting is sometimes so damned expensive, and nowadays it just comes down to following one’s own idea at all costs. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b454 V/19My dear Theo, I wanted to send these off before you come here, because otherwise it’ll be rather a long time. And after that I’ll start working again on very different things. I think you’ll see in the ones that I’m bringing back from the heath that it’s pretty real there. The interiors are deuced fine, and I’ve now made some acquaintances among the people, where I can go. What I’ll do now is — if the month may perhaps have turned out rather better for you than expected, if you could send something more — even if it isn’t much — then I’ll send the 4 canvases. Otherwise — see above — I can’t really get them off. These figure studies — I’d like you to bring them back with you when you come, though. For there are going to be many more that I need for painting. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b455 V/19My dear Theo, The reason why I don’t send them off is that I don’t want to send them to you with the carriage unpaid at a moment when you say that you might be short yourself, and I can’t pay the carriage myself either. That’s to say, living in those cottages day in and day out, being out in the fields just like the peasants — enduring the heat of the sun in the summer, the snow and frost in the winter, not indoors but outside, and not for a walk, but day in and day out like the peasants themselves. And now I must close soon — I did need, though, just to talk about the fact that those who paint the life of the peasants or the common people, although they aren’t counted among the men of the world — will still, however, perhaps endure better in the long run than the makers of the exotic but painted in Paris harems and cardinals’ receptions.  Rather than saying there has to be character in a digger — I describe it by saying this peasant has to be a peasant, this digger has to dig, and then there’s something in it that is essentially modern. But I feel that people can draw conclusions I don’t mean even from these words — even were I to add a whole list. Instead of reducing the expenses for models — which are already quite a burden on me — I think it would be desirable — very desirable — if I could increase them a little. Because I’m concerned with something very different from being able to do ‘a little figure’ drawing. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b456 a-c V/1962 The letter is unsigned, and consequently may be incomplete.   Schinman Fields said: ‘Thus by the 1870s and 1880s, the ragpicker in literature had evolved from a picturesque character to a symbol of the outcast human debris of industrial society. In the visual arts, however, this change would have to wait for Raffaëlli. ... His figures [of ragpickers] are always depicted before a landscape as if he were commenting on the circumstances of the existence of these marginal members of society’ (pp. 158, 160My dear Theo,  But that I’m concerned with taking the primary colours red, blue, yellow, as starting-points, as points of departure, and not grey. We’ll have a hard time — but don’t blame me too much, for with perseverance there’s still a good chance later of reaping what we sow. I’m worried enough about your money troubles, though, I wish I could lighten them a little for you. But they’re not so very numerous — and they’re no less necessary than in the past. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b453 V/19My dear Theo, I thought this would perhaps work out best — since then they’ll still have you at home the whole evening. I’m rather busy, since they’re harvesting the wheat in the fields and, as you know, this takes only a few days and is certainly almost the most beautiful of all. But I’ll make sure to be in my studio today between 3 and 5. In the evening I’ll drop in at Ma’s for a talk. But for the rest, you mustn’t take it amiss of me if I keep on working. With a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b457 V/1962 On 14 September 1919 Andries Bonger wrote to Karel Joan Lodewijk Alberdingk Thijm (the writer Lodewijk van Deyssel): ‘We hardly know Brabant at all. I visited Vincent van Gogh there in ’85 when he was living in Nuenen. I have lovely memories of our evening strolls among the wheatfields and our visits to the homes of the weavers’ (FR b1443My dear Theo, What very much distresses me in our conversation is that when I say that I fear it will be tight for you this year, you reply: ‘that you observe that I’d like to see that’, ‘that you see very well that you can’t rely on me’, ‘that you know very well that I would be returning you no thanks for your pains’. This is not so, and it distresses me that this is how you see it. Should you doubt the good faith of this request, then for my part I can do nothing but repeat it more emphatically. For I notice that on the side of the paint bill, my own little craft is springing leaks here and there. If I don’t have the same ideas as you, don’t suspect me of bad faith or base intentions anyway, either towards you or towards those at home. I do nothing to those at home that I have no right to do, since I absolutely and always keep out of their affairs. Don’t ask for or urge advice, keep entirely to my own territory — and even keep my feelings about their affairs to myself too, since we don’t understand one another’s interests anyway. Regards, Yours truly, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b459 V/19My dear Theo, Your visit really left me with a less than favourable impression — I believe more than ever that more difficulties await you in the next few years than you imagine. You take it as though I was doing you wrong or was hostile to you, now I most decidedly have rather a lot of remarks to make. And considerable concerns for the future. I can’t speak other than I did, can I? To my mind you don’t in the least belong among the rising men now. Take this amiss of me — if you will — and treat me as you will accordingly.  It’s too up in the air for me, too little at ground level. And art itself is solid enough, that’s not the trouble. And the positions in it dependent on chance and whim. Make a miscalculation — make what may be an insignificant mistake — and — what’s left of that huge figure you’re turning over now? That figure depends on G&Cie’s whim. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent But I don’t refuse to take such measures — and even if one of these colourmen wanted to sell off my bits and pieces, he would be welcome to go to those lengths. It’s certain that the paint-dealing gentlemen wouldn’t blush to do it. However, I’m fed up with talking about it; I’ve said what I had to say — and you — you can deal with my suggestion as you see fit.  For your information, this is how it is with me for the rest of the year, precisely and in detail — I have to pay: Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b460 a-b V/19My dear Theo, And I say once more, let’s keep my little painting business in order, because sooner or later we might be in sore need of it. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b461 V/19My dear Theo, Yours truly, Vincent And as regards The Hague — I consider it possible that some people whom I know and who are now against me, could be persuaded. And although it may have to take a long time, I shan’t give up easily as yet, that I can assure you. The Ingres is very good to draw on — and I’m pleased with these sketchbooks. This is what I must get to the bottom of and should re-read. The other chapters are also important, and his definitions well thought out. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b462 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b1035 V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, Even so, I have a few more new drawings. The fact that I have a definite belief as regards art also means that I know what I want to get in my own work, and that I’ll try to get it even if I go under in the attempt. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b463 V/19My dear Theo, I wanted to drop you a line to tell you that I have a few things ready that I wanted to send you. I’ll send them to you as soon as I have the money because am at the end of the month. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b464 V/19My dear Theo, Anyway, you’ll just have to see. I’ll write to you again at the end of this week, when I’m back from the little trip to Amsterdam. Since I have to pay my rent again next month, I can hardly afford the expense. But it’s essential. So more soon. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b465 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I’d already put it off and put it off, that and so much else, because of the cost. But it’s much better that I can no longer imagine that this is the thing to do. I get too much out of it — for my work, and when I look at the old paintings, which I can decipher as regards technique very differently from before — then perhaps I have precious little need for conversation anyway. Into that grey he now introduces blue and orange — and some white. The doublet has satin ribbons of a divine soft blue. Sash and flag orange — a white collar. I stood there literally rooted to the spot. Now you know the singer, that laughing chap — bust in a greenish black with carmine. The two little panels I painted in Amsterdam were done in a tearing hurry, one of them, mark you, in the station waiting room when I was a bit early for the train, the other one in the morning, before I went to the museum at about 10 o’clock. Even so, I’m sending them to you, in the manner of tiles on which one has dashed something off with a few strokes. As regards the end of this month — old chap, I’m literally cleaned out — what’s to be done? Couldn’t you send an extra twenty francs or something? I have to pay for paint again next month, 1 Nov. 25 guilders rent. As regards connections for my work — I did speak to someone, and if I ever go again I’ll take work with me. There’s a general laxness that MAKES it EASY ENOUGH as regards finding a chance to exhibit. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b466 a-c V/1962  My dear Theo, I think it’s better to take off a part that goes wrong with a palette knife and start again from the beginning than to keep coming back to it. In the winter I’m going to explore various things regarding manner that I noticed in the old paintings. I saw a great deal that I needed. I should have realized earlier that I’m most probably boring you with this letter. But I simply didn’t think about it; for my part I can say that I wish you’d write to me about your impressions of things in the Louvre or Luxembourg or of anywhere else. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b467 a-c V/1962 Haverman wrote to Albert Plasschaert on 9 May 1912: ‘I indeed knew Vincent van Gogh in Brussels (1881 or thereabouts). But didn’t meet him often, because very soon we were having quite fierce arguments. I made a few etchings, but no impressions of them have been published; they were more in the way of trials in a rudimentary state’ (FR b3028). As well as the artists Van Gogh mentions here, the De Goncourts also discuss La Tour, Greuze, Saint-Aubin, Gravelot, Cochin, Eisen, Moreau, Debucourt and Prudhon. Several editions of this book, in a number of volumes, were available in 188My dear Theo, The one is a neutral colour, obtained by breaking blue with orange, the other the same neutral colour, only altered by the addition of some yellow. Red ochre and yellow ochre forming an orange, their combination with blue is more neutral, and they become either redder or yellower against that neutralized colour. The highest light on that whole canvas is quite simply some pure yellow ochre. And the fact that this matt yellow still stands out is because it’s in a wide field of a sort, albeit neutral, of violet; after all — red ochre with a blue gives violet tones. They struck me as very good. Particularly one with a gold vase, a few empty oyster shells, a broken coconut shell and a crust of bread. If I mix red and green to a reddish green or greenish red, Isn’t this clear? If I mix yellow with violet to a lilac yellow or yellow lilac, in other words to a neutralized yellow or a neutralized lilac, by adding white and black I get greys. To my mind, speaking of light and of dark greys and browns is expressing it correctly. Yours truly, Vincent The third question is a light blue against the same dark blue, a pink against a brown red, a lemon yellow against fawn yellow, &c. But the first question is the most important. And if you find some book or other on colour questions that is good, do be sure to send it to me, for I too know far from everything about it, and go on searching every day. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b468 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Tulip mania may have perished, BULB-GROWING REMAINS. And for my part I’m content, for better or worse, to be a little gardener who loves his nursery. Now a seascape, with the most delicate blue-greens and broken blue, and all sorts of pearly tones. Then an autumn landscape with foliage from deep wine red to vivid green, from bright orange to dark havana, with yet more colours in the sky in greys, lilacs, blue, white, forming another contrast to the yellow leaves. Then again a sunset in black, in violet, in fiery red. Then again more capricious, like the corner of a garden by him that I saw and have never forgotten; black in the shadow, white in the sun, bright green, a fiery red, and then again a dark blue, a bituminous greenish brown and a light brownish yellow. Truly colours that can have quite a lot to say to one another. I mean, when one wants to paint a head, say, and one looks closely at the nature one has before one, then one might think, this head is a harmony of reddish brown, violet, yellow, all broken — I’ll put a violet and a yellow and a reddish brown on my palette, and break them into each other. Rather a watercolour that’s somewhat vague and unfinished, on the other hand, than one that has been worked up to capture reality. What do I care that the portrait of a worthy citizen tells me precisely what the milk and water, pinkish, purplish, nondescript colour of the pious man’s face — which I’d never seen — is? But the fellow citizens of the little town where the individual in question made himself so estimable that he felt it incumbent upon him to keep posterity familiar with his physiognomy — are very edified by the speaking likeness. That background is so magnificent in that it came about of its own accord, spontaneously, from a colour calculation. Am I wrong about this? All that architecture and sky is conventional and subordinate to the figures, calculated to make the figures show up well. One begins by fruitlessly working oneself to death to follow nature, and everything is contrary. The greatest, most powerful imaginations have also made things directly from reality that leave one dumbfounded. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b469 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b470 V/1962  My dear Theo, I’m more and more convinced that the true painters didn’t finish in the sense in which people all too often used finish — that’s to say clear if one stands with one’s nose pressed to it. I believe I’m making progress with the work. But because it had affected him, I gave it to him, and he accepted it just as I meant it, without many words, that’s to say little other than — ‘the thing’s damned good’. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b471 a-b V/1962 Chardins ‘bonhomie’ is discussed on pp. 149-150; on the hardships in his life it says that his first wife was sickly, that his work did not sell well and that later in life he was ‘weary, ill, weakened’ (lassé, malade, affaibli) p. 144) – at the end of his life he suffered from kidney stones and was confined to bed with swollen legs (p. 153).My dear Theo, It goes without saying that I’d telegraph you if there were something at home. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b472 V/19My dear Theo, That really has remained fundamentally true. Seeing as you’d marked the above, I considered it possible you might want to know what I intend to do next, especially since I’ve just informed you that I’ve given notice on my current studio.  Well roughly, my plan is to go to Antwerp — I can’t possibly calculate the ins and outs beforehand. I’ve come by the addresses of 6 art dealers, so I’d want to take something with me and further, as to the work, I plan to paint a few views of the city as soon as I get there — reasonably large — — and show them straightaway too. In other words concentrate everything on doing something there. And going there poor, at any rate I can’t lose much. Now as regards here — I know the area and the folk too well and love them too much to believe I’m going for good. I’ll see about renting a place to store my things, and then I’m also covered should I want to leave Antwerp for a while — or should become homesick for the country. Don’t forget, either, that I’m not cut out to be a melancholic. The nickname I have around here is generally ‘the little painter fellow’, and it’s not entirely without a measure of malice that I’m going there. I’ve also thought of Drenthe, though, but as more difficult to bring about. That would be good, though, should my work from the countryside be liked in Antwerp. If the things from here were liked, either now or later, then I would continue with them, and vary them with similar things from Drenthe. Silently understanding how it would by no means be a misfortune for her were it to be that she didn’t live very much longer and departed without much suffering, serenity is justifiable in this regard. Serenity too, though, were it to be that years of relatively mechanical life remained. You see that I wanted to arrange my going to Antwerp at around the same time as their trip, which will be over around February. Between then and their final move, I’ll either be back in Nuenen or — if something exceptional detained me longer, nonetheless always ready to be present right away if something happened. Yours truly, Vincent Write soon and tell me what you think about my going to Antwerp — I don’t believe there’s anything against it. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b473 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Lastly, he seemed to find it very natural that she was sometimes a little bit dazed, and didn’t make anything of it. So she can do whatever she likes and doesn’t have to feel awkward about travelling or moving house. I imagine that it’ll be beautiful there in the winter, too, with snow on the docks. Obviously I’ll take a few paintings with me, and they’ll be the ones that I would otherwise have sent to you in the next few days. SO THE SOONER I CAN GET AWAY, THE BETTER. I don’t think this winter will be dull. It’s obvious that it’ll mainly be a question of working hard. But there’s something singular in the very idea that one has to take the plunge. Since I’m already busy packing up my things, it goes without saying that my thoughts are more there than here. The horizon is a dark line against a light line of sky in white and blue. In this dark line little flecks of red, bluish and green or brown, forming the silhouette of the roofs and orchards, the field greenish. The sky higher up, grey, against it the black trunks and yellow leaves. Foreground completely covered with fallen yellow leaves, in which 2 little black figures and one blue. On the right a birch trunk, white and black, and a green trunk with red-brown leaves. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b474 a-b V/1962 (sheets 1, 2) and d314 V/1970 (sheet My dear Theo, As regards my certainly feeling the lack of a studio in Antwerp, yes, that’s so. But I have to choose between a studio without work here, and work without a studio there. I took the latter. And with pleasure that’s actually so great that it feels to me like a return from exile. After all, I’ve been out of the world of painting altogether for a long time. And in the meantime my powers have matured somewhat, so that I feel more independent of the usual intrigues to chuck someone out. I mean that in The Hague I was weaker than the rest with a brush, I don’t say in my drawing, and by attacking me on the painting and colour, I was more easily confounded than will prove possible now. Yours truly, Vincent Ruins Old men, when near them, week by week,  Time has ravaged fruits and flowers in turn, Old men, like Roman cities, have in their hearts A forum – dead, with ruined temples strewn. A silent waste through which their souls Parade at length their barren tedium; where box and nettle And the solitary grass, across the ancient site Have choked the glory of its clamorous pomp. Where words effaced from speechless pediments Conceal their sense beneath the rusty stain of years. No more songs now – the birds love blossom-time. No rainbow prisms colouring the mists, But sober suns, immense horizons, Lighting the beauty at the ruins’ back. Jules Breton Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b475 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b1469/V1962 (sheet My dear Theo, I like Antwerp, have explored various parts of the city, it’s authentic down by the wharves. Well — it can’t do any harm to know Antwerp a little, though it’ll probably be the same as everything and everywhere, that’s to say disillusioning, but yet with its own subtle distinctions. And besides, it’s good to have a change sometimes. Regards, write soon if you will. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b476 V/19Saturday evening My dear Theo, I’ve already walked in all directions around these docks and wharves several times. It’s a strange contrast, particularly when one comes from the sand and the heath and the tranquillity of a country village and hasn’t been in anything but quiet surroundings for a long time. It’s an incomprehensible confusion. I’d like to walk with you there to find out whether we look at things the same way. I mean, the figures there are always in motion, one sees them in the most peculiar settings, everything fantastic, and interesting contrasts keep appearing of their own accord. A white horse in the mud, in a corner where heaps of merchandise lie covered with a tarpaulin — against the old, black, smoke-stained walls of the warehouse. Quite simple — but a Black and White effect. She raises her eyelids momentarily and looks with a slanting glance out of a pair of jet-black eyes. It’s a Chinese girl, mysterious, quiet as a mouse, small, like a bedbug by nature. What a contrast to the group of Flemish mussel eaters. Another contrast — people passing along a very narrow street between formidably tall houses. Warehouses and stores. But down at street level, alehouses for all nations with the corresponding male and female individuals. Shops selling food, sailors’ clothes, colourful and bustling. This street is long, one keeps seeing authentic scenes, and once in a while there’s a commotion, louder than usual, when a quarrel breaks out. For instance, you’re walking along, looking around, and suddenly a great cheer goes up and all sorts of shouting. In broad daylight a sailor is being thrown out of a brothel by the girls and pursued by a furious fellow and a string of girls. Of whom he is apparently terrified — at any rate, I saw him scramble over a pile of sacks and disappear through a window into a warehouse. Once one’s had enough of this racket — at the end of the berths where the Harwich and Le Havre boats lie — having the city behind one — one sees — in front of one, nothing, absolutely nothing but an infinity of flat, half-flooded pasture, incredibly sad and wet, undulating dry reeds, mud — the river with a single small black boat, water in the foreground grey, sky misty and cold, grey — silent as a desert. The overall effect of the port or of a dock — sometimes it’s more tangled and fantastic than a thorn-hedge, so tangled that one can find no rest for the eye, so that one gets dizzy, is forced by the flickering of colours and lines to look now here and now there, unable to tell one thing from another even after staring at a single spot for a long while. I don’t consider it impossible that I might be able to come by some good models by painting portraits. Today I got my things and tools — which I was eagerly awaiting. And so I have my studio in order. If I could come by good models at virtually no expense I wouldn’t be afraid of anything. I don’t reckon it a bad thing, either, that I haven’t any money, as much as it would take to force things by paying. Perhaps the idea of painting portraits and getting the sitters to pay for them by posing is a safer way. Because in the city it’s not like it is with the peasants. Anyway. One thing’s certain, Antwerp’s a very singular and beautiful place for a painter. I’ve reconciled myself to having left — and hope not to be idle this winter. See that you send your letter off on the first, because I’ve got enough bread in until then, but after that I’d be in a real stew. My little room isn’t bad at all, and it definitely doesn’t look dreary. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent It’s curious that my painted studies look darker here in the city than in the country — is this because the light isn’t as bright anywhere in the city? I don’t know — but it might differ more than one would say on the face of it. It struck me, and I could understand that things that are with you also appear darker than I thought they were in the country. Still, the ones I’ve brought with me now don’t look bad all the same — the mill — avenue of autumn trees and still life, and a few small ones. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b477 V/19My dear Theo, Ah! I’ll say it again, if I could only get the models I want! What leaves me quite cold are the mass of German girls, all manufactured from a single model one would say, that one sees at the café concerts. It seems that one sees that same breed everywhere nowadays, like Bavarian beer. It seems to be an article that’s exported in bulk. I’m bored to tears by all these German elements that lurk wherever one goes these days. It’s sure to be just the same in Paris, with the Boches worming their way in everywhere. Anyway, it’s a boring thing to talk about. Seeing some paintings by other people has given me all sorts of ideas for when I’m back in the country in the spring; at the same time my confidence to carry on with all the strength at my disposal is being boosted in general. Antwerp is a beautiful colour, and it’s worthwhile for the subjects alone. I’d be able to do more if I were better off. But I’m partly dependent on my purse as far as production is concerned. Do write to me again if you have time. The end of the month would certainly be hard unless you can give me a little support then. For me, so much may depend on my being able to stick to my guns. And one can’t afford to look hungry or wretched. On the contrary, one must see to it that one helps to liven things up. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b478 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I’ve bought some more paint and two new types of drawing brush which I’m extremely pleased with and with which I can work more accurately. Then the canvases I brought with me were too small for the heads, since using other colours means I need more room for my surroundings. All this and the models are ruining me. I’m telling you this as urgently as possible, because if one has to lose time, one loses double. Ah — a painting has to be painted — and why not simply? If I look at life itself now — I have similar impressions. I see the people in the street — very well — but I often find the servant girls so much more interesting and beautiful than the ladies — the labourers more interesting than the gentlemen. And I find a power and vitality in those common girls and fellows which, to express them in their singular character, would have to be done with a firm brushstroke, with a simple technique. At the moment I’m getting more and more accustomed to talking to the models while I’m painting, so as to keep the liveliness in their faces. Regards, do write again between times if you will. As to the money, do what you can, but know this, that we have to do our utmost to succeed. And I’m not abandoning my idea of the portraits, because it’s a cause worth fighting for to show people that there’s something else in human beings besides what the photographer is able to get out of them with his machine. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent I’ve noticed the many photographers here, who are much the same as everywhere and apparently have plenty to do. But always the same conventional eyes, noses, mouths, waxy and smooth and cold.  And painted portraits have a life of their own that comes from deep in the soul of the painter and where the machine can’t go. The more photographs one looks at, it seems to me, the more one feels this. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b479 a-b V/1962   Van Gogh, who had been in Amsterdam for a few days in September, must have heard or read about this topical issuMy dear Theo, All the same, I’d so much rather paint figures — I also think that the market could get rather full of landscapes, and although one has far more difficulties with figures because of the models — all the same, it may be a better chance. What the dealers say is that they still think women’s heads or figures of women are most likely to sell. This spring I’ll have to decide whether or not I’ll stay in the Nuenen area. I’d like you to give the question some thought. I don’t feel dejected as long as I’m painting, but in the long run — the periods in between can sometimes be very depressing. And it grieves me when I can’t develop things a little, and one’s always between the devil and the deep sea. For you have to understand, for instance, that ever since I’ve been here I’ve only had some hot food 3 times, and that otherwise it’s always just bread. Thus one becomes more of a vegetarian than is good for one. Particularly when it had to be the same in Nuenen for a good six months, and I still couldn’t even manage to settle my paint bill. Don’t they understand that themselves — that precisely when one has ceased to be angry about it, it has definitely become a matter of stranger than strangers to one another? Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b480 V/19My dear Theo, I have to tell you, though, that I’m really hard pressed now — out of the near enough five francs that I still had — I had to buy two canvases for those two portraits, and my laundry has just come back. So that at the moment I have a few centimes left. So what I’m urgently asking you is: for God’s sake don’t put off writing, and send me a lot or a little, such as you have — but know that I’m starving, literally. But whatever I want to begin and where — I have to be able to show things, that goes without saying. Since I need all my high spirits, all my energy — putting it bluntly, I dread feeling physically weak. I’m convinced that something can be done here. There seem to be a lot of beautiful women in this city, and it has to be the case that there’s money to be earned with either women’s portraits or imaginary women — heads and figures. It’s a real pleasure for me to work with a rather better type of brush, and to have cobalt and carmine and a good brilliant yellow and vermilion. The most expensive is still sometimes the cheapest. Cobalt especially — it can’t be compared with any other blue as regards the delicate tones that one can get with it. And the quality of the colour may not be everything in a painting, but all the same that’s what gives it vitality. As to whether or not I’d live here permanently — given that things don’t look exactly rosy in the art trade — and there seems to be something of a tendency for each painter to be his own dealer — which I imagine will increase still further in the long run — it might be wise to keep a studio here. Why — for the trade — are all paintings always in frames? As a commercial article there’s surely sometimes a lot to be said for something’s being light and easy to handle and to move. The trade is old-fashioned and... thrice mouldered. There has to be renewal — and the old systems don’t exactly work well any more. The prices — the public — everything needs renewing. And the future is working cheaply for the bourgeoisie, perhaps. At any rate — the ordinary art lovers themselves seem to be getting more and more set, becoming hard. Anyway. Starting with capital so often only leads to losing everything first, and thus one’s courage and zest for work, too. Whereas starting with virtually nothing at least makes someone more decisive and firmer of character. Anyway. Regards — but see that you write to me by return, for I have a faint sensation in my body because I’ve exerted myself rather a lot on this and that, and I need my strength. Regards. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b481 V/19My dear Theo, It’s high time that I thanked you for the 50 francs you sent, which enable me to get through the month, even if starting from today it’s pretty much the same again. But — there are a few more studies done, and I believe that as much as I paint, I also progress by as much. As soon as I received the money I got an attractive model and painted a life-size head. It’s all light except for the black hair. Even so, the head itself stands out in tone against a background in which I’ve tried to get a golden gleam of light. Here, by the way, is the colour spectrum — a tonal flesh colour, more bronzy in the neck. Jet-black hair — black that I had to make with carmine and Prussian blue, dingy white for the jacket, light yellow, much lighter than the white, for the background. Then I knew what to do, and I tried to get something voluptuous and sad at the same time. And now I hope to paint a man’s head too, during these last days of the month. I’m in really good spirits, particularly as regards the work, and it’s useful for me to be here. I imagine that, no matter what these girls may be, one can make one’s money out of them like this sooner than in any other way. There’s no gainsaying that they can be damned beautiful, and it’s in keeping with the spirit of the age that this is the very kind of painting that wins the day. Personal initiative with little or no capital is perhaps the seed for the future. Anyway. What I have to do, and the only thing that can be sure to help me progress, is work a great deal with models. That I needn’t despair of reaching the age that’s necessary for producing a body of work. I told him that I knew several painters who, despite all their nerves etc., had reached 60, even 70, fortunately for them, and that I would like to reach that too. Then I believe that if one seeks serenity and retains a zest for life, the frame of mind one’s in helps a lot. And in this respect I’ve gained by coming here, because I have new ideas and I have new means of expressing what I want, because better brushes will help me, and I’m really carried away by those two colours, carmine and cobalt. Cobalt — is a divine colour, and there’s nothing so fine as that for putting space around things. Carmine is the red of wine, and it’s warm, spirited as wine. So too is emerald green. It’s false economy to do without them, those colours. Cadmium likewise. You really must still write and tell me whether it seems such an absurd idea to you that one might create a bit more courage if one were to plant a seed for a business. As regards the work I’m doing now — I feel that I can do something better — I need more air and space, though. I mean I must be able to expand it a bit. Above all, above all, I still haven’t got enough models. I can produce work of a higher quality, but my expenses would be heavier. But isn’t it so — shouldn’t one search for something high — for the real, for something distinguished? As long as I’m painting it’s more than enough for me, but when my models have gone, a feeling of weakness comes over me. I really like the models here because they’re so very different from the models in the country. And above all because the character is something so very different. And the contrast gives me new ideas, particularly for the flesh tones. Anyway, be that as it may — I want to make progress at all costs, and — I want to be myself. I’m feeling obstinate, too, and I’ve got over caring what people say about me or my work. It seems to be difficult to get a nude model here — at least the girl I’ve had wouldn’t do it. Obviously that — wouldn’t — is probably relative, but at any rate it can’t be taken as a matter of course. The thing is, though, she would be splendid. From the point of view of business, I can’t say anything other than that — we’re in what people are already beginning to call ‘the end of an era’ — the women have a charm as in a time of revolution — and just as much to say, for that matter — and that one would be withdrawn from the world if one worked without them. It’s the same everywhere, in the country and in the city — one must take women into account if one wants to keep up with the times. Adieu, best wishes for the New Year. With a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b482 a-c V/1962  My dear Theo, It’s already late, but I don’t want to put off reporting the safe receipt of your letter and 150 francs. I couldn’t get near enough to examine the technique from very close to, which would have been worthwhile. The head of Christ is less conventional than the Flemish painters usually conceive it. I imagine, though, that I can do it like that too, and the painting didn’t tell me anything new. Oh, if only one could get the models that one wanted!!! Now tell me — supposing first and foremost that you want to be a financier — and I have nothing against that, in fact I even highly approve of it — are you entirely happy with your own reasoning, when you say to me at the beginning of the year, to my disappointment: I have a very great deal to pay and you’ll just have to see that you manage until the end of the month? Shall we now say, like the damned bores and fools: we can’t, we haven’t any money, there’s nothing to be done? And that the desire I have to expand my affairs is good not just for me, but for you too, because it’s only by this means that we can earn. Are such things necessary or not??? Does anything depend on them, yes or no??? I can’t tell you how delighted I still am that I came to Antwerp. And how much there is to observe here for me, who has been out of things for so long. How much good it does me — much as I love the peasants and countryside — to observe a city again. How the bringing together of extremes gives me new ideas — extremes, the countryside as a whole and the bustle here. I really needed it. But I’ve seen through it all too well to hesitate. And I’ve recovered my self-confidence and serenity. Backwards — it offends me. They wrote to me from home at New Year and I also sent a postcard. But writing wouldn’t work, while I moreover believe that unconsciously, as a matter of course, they tell everyone everything, so — I wrote — goodbye for now — after all I’ll probably see them in the spring for some time. I must close. What the coloration in a painting is — it’s surely the enthusiasm in life and so — it’s no small matter to seek and preserve it. Regards and with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b483 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Thus in The elevation of the Cross, even — the pale spot — the body a high, light accent — is dramatic in the context of its contrast with the rest, which has been pitched so low. The same thing, but to my mind far more beautiful, is the charm of The descent from the Cross, where the pale spot is repeated by the blonde hair, pale faces and necks of the female figures, while the sombre setting is immensely rich because of those various low masses, brought together by the tone, of red, dark green, black, grey, violet. And I must find some way of getting help in that regard. In any event, I think that I’ll stay in Antwerp itself for a while, instead of going back to the country. It would be so much better than postponing it, and there’s so much more opportunity here of finding people who might take an interest in it. I feel that I dare do something and can do something, and things have already been dragging on for far too long. For my part I’ll admit that something else is needed when working absolutely from nature — facility of composition — knowledge of the figure — but after all — I don’t think I’ve been putting myself to all this trouble for years for absolutely nothing. I feel a certain power in me because, wherever I may go, I’ll always have a goal — painting people as I see and know them. So just let me scratch around, and for heaven’s sake don’t lose heart or weaken. I don’t think that you can reasonably ask me to go back to the country for the sake of perhaps 50 francs a month less, when the whole stretch of years ahead is so closely related to the associations I have to establish in town, either here in Antwerp or later in Paris. As regards this month, I really do definitely have to insist that you manage to send me at least another 50 francs. At the moment I’m losing weight, and moreover my clothes are getting too bad &c. You know very well yourself that this won’t do. All the same, I have a degree of confidence that we can pull through. But you said that if I became ill we’d be in even more of a state — I hope it won’t come to that, but I would like to be a little bit more comfortable, precisely so as to prevent that. Anyway — when one thinks how many people just go on living without ever in their lives having even a notion of care — and who always just think that everything will turn out for the best. As if people didn’t starve — and no one ever perished. I’m beginning to object more and more to your imagining yourself to be a financier and, for instance, thinking the exact opposite of me. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b484 V/19My dear Theo, I also have to go to two people with a view to portraits; I don’t know if anything will come of it. And the other is a portrait of a married woman. But I tell you, nothing is settled yet and it could fall through. I do know, though, that if need be I’d be prepared to do them for nothing, just so that I can practise. But, when you think that I’ll have to go and work either there or elsewhere at someone’s home etc., I’ll have to do something about my clothes, because I’ve been wearing mine for two years and they’ve suffered, particularly recently. If it were just a 40-franc suit, say, it would be good enough. Accordingly. Try, as I asked you, to send 50 francs, then I can get by till the end of the month and would buy myself a new pair of trousers and waistcoat at once, and the jacket in February. It’s dreadfully cold here, and I often feel far from well, but anyway, as long as the painting’s going, that doesn’t really matter. Anyway. But do your best to write to me soon, and it’s really necessary that I have that extra 50 francs for the month. I won’t manage otherwise, and things are too urgent. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b485 V/19My dear Theo, I’ve been painting there for a few days now and it suits me very well. Above all because there are all sorts of painters there, and I see them working in very diverse ways — something I’ve never had — often seeing other people at work. It’s by far the best for me to stay there for a long time — for the models there are good and it’ll work out better that way. It would be a great help to me if I could have your letter by Monday. What I wrote to you about clothes I need is also rather urgent. So far I’ve already made a few acquaintances there, who had seen the things that I’d taken in in order to be admitted. There are devilish good ones among the studies by past students that are hanging there. I don’t think that I can take a shorter route to progress, and whether I go to the country later or come to a studio in Paris, in any event it’s good for me to see a lot of painting and above all keep working regularly from models, as much as is in any way possible. Regards — I’m writing to you in haste because I have to go out again. But still do your utmost best not to keep me waiting, for the work depends on it, and I assure you that it’ll be hard enough for me in any event. With a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b486 V/19My dear Theo, I’ve already left it too long to confirm the safe receipt of your letter and the enclosure. As regards your letter, it’s still the same and, to my mind, when you judge me you rely too much on generalities and on prejudices that are too superficial and too wrong for me to be able to believe that you’ll always stick to them. Further, just to be admitted anywhere in Paris one has to have been somewhere else and have lost one’s rough edges, and one always has to contend with fellows who’ve already worked at an academy for some length of time. And I think it’s true — so I have to see to it that I’m somewhere where I have access to both the antique and nude models at first. I think you’ll remember: The Greeks don’t start from the outline, they start from the centres, from the cores. So you see how it is. But it’s not bad, though, and one mustn’t get angry about it, and must keep quiet just as if one would really like to break oneself of it, that bad manner, but unfortunately keeps slipping back into it. What I ask you very earnestly for the sake of things working out well, is not to lose your patience, nor above all your optimism, for we’d be cutting our own throats if our courage were to fail us precisely as the moment presents itself when we could acquire a degree of influence if we show that we know what we want, and dare to do something and manage to see it through. So at the same time it’s cheapest to stay in a studio — because for more finished nude studies, above all, it’s not possible to pay the cost of the model oneself. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b487 V/19My dear Theo, Of course all my attention is concentrated on gaining what I want to gain. Namely a clear field to make a career. Namely to find my feet instead of going under. I’ve already told you that my constitution is at a very low ebb, and that I must act energetically to put it right. I’ve already told you that there’s no reason to go and work in the country again for the first year — that it’s infinitely better for the whole future if I draw plaster casts and nudes in town. And to express the criticism briefly — the big houses that became the focus of the art trade and reached their greatest growth and expansion in, let’s say, 68/70 - 76 — that have maintained their prestige since then only with difficulty and by bullying — will they be able to hold out or not? Both in painting and in literature (I don’t know about music, but I imagine that it will have been the same thing there). Given that in a time of monetary crisis like the present, money is what ammunition is to a soldier in a hostile country — let’s not waste our powder. Furthermore — I hear various people complaining, both painters and — ordinary people: ‘I took a fine room because people were going to come to me, and no one’s come to me since, and I don’t feel at home there myself.’ Still, I do believe that for portraits it’s necessary to create a degree of comfort in a studio, otherwise the people who come to sit will dislike it. But if one wants to start on that, one must think about where one rents it, where one has the best chance of getting visitors and making friends and becoming known. So the wisest thing would be if I were to come to Paris and we were to put it off for a year — in that year we can get to know each other better at close quarters  which can change a lot — and then we can be less afraid to start expanding a little, because in the meantime we’ll have strengthened the weak points. But what should I do now? Look here, to go back to Brabant is actually a detour, and I’ll lose time and money on it. Why can’t I go straight from here to Paris whenever you like, and carry on working here until I go? I’d also be obliged to pay for some paint — and of course I’d begin to paint again there too. I think you must appreciate this. When you consider how I’d already been complaining recently that it couldn’t go on like this, you see it really wasn’t for nothing. Even then, we still inevitably have the cost of travelling from here to Paris. You have to move, too, which also won’t happen by itself. As things are now I have to live from one day to the next, and what’s owing has to wait. In the end, it doesn’t bother me, but I just tell you what’s right and I point out to you the urgency of going on with what will enable us to make progress. It’s not pleasant for me to come back ill either — you see — and you can’t deny that. Let me recover first, I’m at much too low an ebb now. Anyway, the summary of this and the last letter is this — Moreover, I’m ill, although I’m keeping going. If I possibly could I wouldn’t object to going back to Brabant even, I’d be happy to do it if I could, but neither you nor I have the means and — they can better spare me there than use me. Regards, write to me soon though. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b494 a-b V/1962 The next ten letters centre on the details of this plan and a move to Paris; initially there is a possibility that Van Gogh will go back to Nuenen for a while first, later he tries to avoid this with increasing insistencMy dear Theo, So now I’m drawing during the day, too, and the teacher there — who presently makes portraits and gets well paid for them — has repeatedly asked me whether I’d never drawn plaster casts before and whether I’d taught myself to draw. And concluded — I see that you’ve done a great deal of work — and, you won’t be long in making progress, you’ll benefit greatly — it will take a year, but what does that matter? As to the portraits, there certainly won’t be much time for them if I want to keep up with everything regularly. And it’s the same here, too.  Be in no doubt, though — the way to succeed is — to keep courage and patience, and to carry on working hard. And it’s important for me to smarten up my appearance a bit. Perhaps you’ll say that it has nothing to do with art — and — perhaps you’ll agree with me. I’m seeing about getting my teeth put right again. I have no fewer than 10 teeth that I’ve either lost or am losing. And that’s too many and too disagreeable, and besides it makes me look as though I’m over 40, which puts me at too much of a disadvantage. This is simply the way it is, and the point is to steer clear of them, clear of the various rocks — and still manage to keep the ship afloat, even if one does sustain damage. So please don’t take this expenditure too much amiss of me; I’ll see that I economize, but it got too bad and I had to do something about it. So let’s write about this again. I’m still pleased that I came here, otherwise I’d have become stuck, and now, although I see there are still many obstacles, I’ve nonetheless got light by which to make progress. And by adding on a stay in Paris or extending it here, we’ll be on surer ground. As to the plan that we should perhaps live together and take a relatively good studio where we could receive people if need be, keep thinking about it, and let me think about it again too. I see drawing first and foremost that year, which I’m afraid there’s no going back on. If you find a good place and it’s not expensive then it can do no harm, but if it’s expensive it might perhaps not be the cheapest way for the first year if we were to be very hard up for money. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b488 a-b V/1962 Van Gogh writes that the painting course ended ‘last week’; this happened at the end of January 1886. He also thanks Theo for sending the regular allowance, which almost always arrived at the beginning of the week. We have therefore dated the letter on or about Tuesday, 2 February 1886. Students drew (classical) plaster casts and from life, and Cormon demanded from his students an extremely accurate, lifelike drawing. He advocated a painting technique based on a dark design, on which the painting was worked up with transparent and light colours. He also encouraged his students to work en plein air; sketching trips were a regular feature of the timetable. The studio was particularly popular with foreign artists. See Gauzi 1992, pp. 16-32; exhib. cat. Paris 1988, pp. 10-27; Welsh-Ovcharov 1976, p. 13; Galbally 1977, pp. 29-30; Destremau 1997.My dear Theo, I already wrote to you the day before yesterday that on the one hand I was far from well, but that on the other hand I nevertheless thought I could see some light. Well I’ve made it worse by smoking a lot, which I did all the more because then one isn’t troubled by one’s empty stomach. Anyway, they say — one has to experience lean times, and I’ve had my share of them. Because it’s not just the food, it’s also all the worry and sorrow that one has. Now it’s true that I didn’t think of this before, or at least didn’t do it — but I wish now that I’d started on it a year earlier. If we could now find some way of living in the same city it would be far and away the best thing, at least for the time being. And don’t think either that the years I worked out of doors were wasted. For it’s the very thing that people who’ve never been anywhere else but at academies and studios lack, that view of reality in which they live, and finding subjects. Anyway. What I think, though, is this — one mustn’t think that people whose constitution is damaged, wholly or half, aren’t fit for painting. It’s desirable for one to make it to 60 at least, and necessary for one to make it to 50, if one begins when one is around 30.  It really struck me so unexpectedly — I did feel weak and feverish, but I still kept going. Only it began to worry me that teeth were breaking off one after another. And that I was starting to look worse and worse. Anyway, we’ll see about putting it right. I think that getting the teeth attended to will help in itself because, as my mouth was usually painful, I just swallowed my food as quickly as possible. And perhaps it will also help my appearance, at least a little. Write to me soon, though, because I really do need it. As regards going to Nuenen too — I want to know what you’d think best. If there’s any point in it, though, I can be ready by March if need be. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b489 a-b V/1962 His son Cornelis Rijken, then aged 14, evidently also worked for the Van Goghs. Cornelis’s son S.A. Rijken wrote about it in a letter of 4 February 1963: ‘At the house of my grandfather A. Rijken, who lived at the time in Beekstraat Nuenen behind the parsonage, there were a couple of looms at the time, drawn and painted by Vincent many times ... His son, my father C. Rijken, was the garden boy at that time and looked after Dr v Gogh’s garden, and also kept the studio clean. As I heard him tell many times, also that he several times pushed the barrow to Nuenen station to take paintings to the train etc.’ (Letter Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, Archives Vincent van Gogh FoundationMy dear Theo, And even so, this is the way to combine forces. And even so, much greater understanding of each other can follow from it. Now what shall I tell you about my health? I still believe that I have a chance of avoiding being really ill; all the same, I’ll need time to get better. I also still have two more teeth to be filled, then my upper jaw, which was most affected, will be all right again. I still have to pay 10 francs for that, and then another 40 francs to get the bottom half right too. And then — even eating the same things, one can naturally digest better when one can chew properly, and so my stomach will have a chance to recover. I really do notice that I’ve been at a very low ebb, though — and as you wrote yourself, all sorts of things that are even worse could arise out of neglecting it. However, we’ll see that we get it put right. I haven’t worked for a few days, gone to bed early a couple of nights (otherwise it was usually 1 or 2 o’clock because of drawing at the club). And I feel that it’s calming me. Further, since you say you’ll have to pay rent until the end of June — well then, perhaps it would be best after all if I were to return to Nuenen, starting in March, only — if I encountered opposition and scenes like I got before I left, I would be wasting my time there and so, even if it were only just for those few months, I’d make a change anyhow, since I want to have some new things from the country ready to bring to Paris with me. He evidently hadn’t expected that and couldn’t say much to refute it this time, but — next time, of course, he’ll be able to start something. Besides, you started by telling me something quite different, that’s to say, you told me: tackle it as you wish. I wish that we could spend a few days together in the Louvre and could just talk about it. I believe it would interest you. Very well — I won’t go into that except in so far as it might make a fatal separation between us where reconciliation is needed. I’m longing dreadfully for the Louvre, Luxembourg etc., where everything will be so new to me. It wouldn’t surprise me if, once the idea of living together takes hold, you’ll find it odder and odder that we’ve been together so surprisingly little, if you will — for fully 10 years. Anyway, I most certainly hope that this will be the end of it, and that it won’t begin again. What you say about the apartment is perhaps really rather expensive. I mean, I’d be just as happy if it weren’t quite as good. I’m curious as to how those few months in Nuenen will be for me. Since I have some furniture there, since it’s beautiful there, too, and I know the district a little, it might be a good thing for me to keep a pied-à-terre there, if need be in an inn where I could leave that furniture, since otherwise it will be lost — and it could still come in very useful. I must finish this now, since I’m going to the club. Keep thinking about what we can best do. Regards. Yours truly, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b490 a-b V/1962 We have spaced the four letters that followed in quick succession at intervals of two and three days over the intervening 12 days, and allocated them the dates of about Saturday, 6, about Tuesday, 9, about Thursday, 11 and Sunday, 14 February 1886. ‘All of a sudden my brother stopped dead and said to me: “It doesn’t matter, do you see, they can deny us all they like… one day it will have to be acknowledged that we created GERMINIE LACERTEUX… and that ‘Germinie Lacerteux’ is the original book that served as the model for everything that has been produced since us, under the name of realism, naturalism, etc. And that’s one! Now through writing, through talk, through purchases… who has imposed on the generation of mahogany chests of drawers the taste for eighteenth-century art and furniture?… Where is he who will dare to say it is not us? And that’s two!  And what about that description of a Paris salon furnished with japonaiseries, published in our first novel, in our novel EN 18.., that appeared in 1851 … yes, in 1851 …– let them show me people with a taste for Japanese things in those days…– and our acquisitions during those years of bronzes and lacquerware from Mallinet and a little later from Mrs Desoye… and our discovery in 1860, at the Porte Chinoise, of the first Japanese album known in Paris… known at least to the world of men of letters and painters… and the pages devoted to Japanese things in MANETTE SALOMON, in IDÉES ET SENSATIONS… do they not make us the first propagators of that art… of that art, which, without doubt, is revolutionizing the perspective of western peoples? And that’s three! Now the search for truth in literature, the revival of eighteenth-century art, the triumph of Japonism: these are, do you know, – he added after a silence, and with an awakening of intelligent life in his eye, – these are the three great literary and artistic movements of the second half of the nineteenth century… and we will have led them, these three movements… us, poor unknown us. Well! when you have done that… it will be really difficult not to be someone in the future.” And it’s true, the dying man taking a walk along the avenue of the Bois de Boulogne could perhaps be right.’ (Tout à coup brusquement mon frère s’arrêta, et me dit: “Ça ne fait rien, vois-tu, on nous niera tant qu’on voudra... il faudra bien reconnaître un jour que nous avons fait GERMINIE LACERTEUX... et que ‘Germinie Lacerteux’ est le livre-type qui a servi de modèle à tout ce qui a été fabriqué depuis nous, sous le nom de réalisme, naturalisme, etc. Et d’un! Maintenant par les écrits, par la parole, par les achats... qu’est-ce qui a imposé à la génération aux commodes d’acajou, le goût de l’art et du mobilier du XVIIIe siècle?... Où est celui qui osera dire que ce n’est pas nous? Et de deux! Enfin cette description d’un salon parisien meublé de japonaiseries, publiée dans notre premier roman, dans notre roman d’EN 18.., paru en 1851 ... oui, en 1851 ... – qu’on me montre les japonisants de ce temps-là... – et nos acquisitions de bronzes et de laques de ces années chez Mallinet et un peu plus tard chez Mme Desoye... et la découverte en 1860, à la Porte Chinoise, du premier album japonais connu à Paris... connu au moins du monde des littérateurs et des peintres... et les pages consacrées aux choses du Japon dans MANETTE SALOMON, dans IDÉES ET SENSATIONS... ne font-ils pas de nous les premiers propagateurs de cet art... de cet art en train, sans qu’on s’en doute, de révolutionner l’optique des peuples occidentaux? Et de trois! Or la recherche du vrai en littérature, la résurrection de l’art du XVIIIe siècle, la victoire du japonisme: ce sont, sais-tu, – ajouta-t-il après un silence, et avec un réveil de la vie intelligente dans l’oeil, – ce sont les trois grands mouvements littéraires et artistiques de la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle... et nous les aurons menés, ces trois mouvements... nous, pauvres obscurs. Eh bien! quand on a fait cela... c’est vraiment difficile de n’être pas quelqu’un dans l’avenir.” ‘The exhibitors reflected the cosmopolitanism which had developed in the Paris art world ... It attracted a public of an equally international scope. Eventually scheduled regularly in May, it was anticipated and attended by fashionable society as well as those with a serious interest in the latest names and trends in art, and the newest output by painters with established reputations’, wrote Roger Terry Dunn, The Monet-Rodin exhibition at the Galerie Georges Petit in 1889. Diss. Northwestern University 1979, pp. 10-1My dear Theo, I have to write to you one more time because the sooner we can take an outright decision the better. As regards a studio — if we could find, in one and the same house, a room with an alcove and also a garret or a corner attic — then you could have that apartment of room and alcove, and we could make it just as comfortable as possible. And during the day the room could serve as studio, and the garret could serve for various more unsightly tools or for dirty work, and I could also sleep there — and you in the studio alcove. So there has to be more life, it seems to me, and we have to throw out all sorts of doubts and a certain lack of confidence. But suppose we both yet see the beginning of it at the end of our lives. Only they all, and rightly, avoid prophesying utopias and are pessimists in so far as if one analyzes, one sees so terribly in the history of this century the way the revolutions fail, no matter how nobly they begin. The ancients won’t prevent us from being realistic, come on — on the contrary. Of course I’m also desperately longing for French paintings. Apropos, don’t you like this? After all, working has the secret of being able to give someone a second youth. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b491 V/19My dear Theo, I definitely need to tell you that it would reassure me greatly if you were to approve my coming to Paris much earlier than June or July if need be. The more I think about it, the more desirable this appears to me. Consider that if everything goes well and if I had good food &c. throughout that time, which will certainly not be plain sailing, consider that even in that case it will take 6 months or so before I’m entirely well. But it would certainly take even longer if things were to be the same for me in Brabant from March to July as they’ve been for the past few months, and it’s likely they’d be no different. Now at the moment it’s just because of reaction to over-exertion that I feel terribly weak, in fact even worse. Still, that’s the natural course of things and nothing unusual. For the rest, we could then also think about it and discuss it so much better before we go about setting ourselves up somewhere else. Know that I don’t mind going to Nuenen in the month of March if need be and seeing how things are there, and how the people are, and whether or not I can get models. But if that doesn’t work out, which is likely, then after March I could come straight to Paris and start drawing, in the Louvre, for instance. And — I think this way I’ll remain more cheerful. I also have to tell you that although I still go there — it’s often insupportable for me, the carping of the fellows at the academy, for it has proved that they’re still spiteful. However, I make a point of avoiding any quarrel, and go my own way. This doesn’t matter so much, though — the issue is to really go on trying to find a better system of working. So, patience and perseverance. Enough about this — just let it bore us so much that we become enthusiastic about something nobler. And that we make haste to achieve it. You also need to take better care of yourself, and should we succeed in uniting, the two of us would know more than each one individually, and could do more. Even in the plaster cast class, 10 male figures as against 1 female figure. That’s nice and easy. Yours truly, Vincent My being in Nuenen, at least for the month of March, would be because of the move, and I ought to go there for myself because of changing my abode. But if need be, as far as I’m concerned, I’d be prepared not to go back at all. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b492 V/19My dear Theo, If I’m not mistaken in this, then I believe that we can’t be together too soon, and I continue to see drawbacks to a stay in the country. For although the air there may be invigorating, I would miss the distractions and sociability of the city. From which we could benefit so much more still if we were together. And a very subtle and more refined and more artistic intelligence was somewhat sterilized. Now, though, that’s what we need to revive again and bring back to life. And were we to be together much more in the near future, I’d disappoint you in things for sure, but not in everything and not in my way of looking at things, I believe. I want to tell you at the start of our conversation about one thing and another that I wish that before too long we could both have acquired a wife, one way or another. Because it’s high time, and because we’d be no better off if we were to wait a long while to do it. Anyway — all that quite coolly. But it’s pretty much a prerequisite for living better. And I mention it because we may perhaps have a huge difficulty to overcome in this respect. And on which much depends. And I’m just breaking the ice about it here; we’ll always have to come back to it. And in relationships with women one learns so much specifically about art. Pity that as one learns by degrees, so by degrees one ceases to be young. But were that not so, life would be too good. It’s such a brilliant idea, working and thinking in concert. And every day I find evidence supporting the proposition that a major reason for many misfortunes among artists lies in the discord between them, in not cooperating, in being nasty, not kind, to one another. And now if we were wiser in this respect, I don’t doubt for a moment that  we’d be on a better path and happier in a year’s time. I’m not getting on very well with the work but I’m not forcing it either, because to all intents and purposes it’s actually forbidden me. And I want to save my strength for that initial period in Paris, should that be the most obvious thing to do first, without an intervening period except, then, for that one month. For I’d like to arrive there fresh. Today — Sunday — it was almost a spring day — this morning I went for a long walk on my own, all through the city, in the park, along the boulevards. It was such weather that in the countryside one would probably have heard the lark for the first time. And in short there was something of a resurrection in the atmosphere. I see just as clearly as the greatest optimist the lark ascending in the spring sky. When one is always in respectable company and among reasonably well-to-do citizens, one may perhaps not notice it so much — but when, like me, one has been through very hard times, then it’s impossible to ignore the fact that great hardship is a factor that weighs in the balance. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b493 V/19My dear Theo, I’m really looking forward to hearing from you. For the time when I have to decide has come. We only have about 10 days until the end of the month, and I do need to know what’s what. But anyway, for my part I’ve decided — only it would be pleasant for me if you could see it the same way as I do. If you agree that the plan of coming to Paris should go ahead as soon as possible — in other words after I’ve been in Brabant for a short while — then I’ll send you from here the studies and drawings I have here. I wanted to get on with that, though. Because otherwise I’ll have to be here for even longer. I’d also so very much like to get the work on my teeth finished. What should I do? Altogether I’ve got one franc fifty left — and as for food, I’ve still got five francs credit until the end of the month. It’s desirable for so many reasons that we take the step of changing quickly. I write to you rather curtly, perhaps, but it may not be put off. We have to put our backs into it; well then, we’ll do that. If we ever want to do anything good, depend upon it that it will increasingly come down to decisiveness and to quite swift action and that, while despite all the effort one might put in, no one can know with certainty the results of his enterprises in advance, some courage and promptness of action can do no harm. If it were in any way possible, I’d like to have the second half of that work on my teeth done this month. I’d like to pack up my studies and send them to you, and leave on the last day of this month or even a few days earlier. But not stay on into March, on account of the rent. And if I could do a little painting or drawing there, so much the better. Yours truly, Vincent If I didn’t do it — go to Paris, that is — then I wouldn’t get any better — for I have to do something about earning more. I’m doing myself no good at all now — if nothing had to be taken off, one could live perfectly well on 150 francs, but there’s always too much to come off. But still, my health is improving — and it will come right. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b495 V/19My dear Theo, It’s at the moment when my money has entirely gone — entirely — that I write to you again. For the rest, you’ll notice in the latest work which you haven’t seen yet that if I give painting something of a rest, I do it very calmly because working with a brush won’t easily elude me. If I hadn’t been ill &c., by the way, I’d have been able to do more here. I definitely believe that we can manage and get back on our feet. But it would be folly if we didn’t discuss it quite coolly and calmly. And we must, both you and I, take care of our health. And what I’m saying about coming straight to Paris is a saving for you because, what with going back and forth, and starting relatively expensive work in Brabant, we won’t manage with the usual, and in Paris we will. And if it turns out better than expected with the money, so much the better, then we won’t be so hard up and could stock up on painting materials before the summer so that everything doesn’t come at once. Don’t take it amiss of me if I also calculate what’s possible and impossible for once. For that matter, it could have happened sooner. Things have been too bad recently and I was too hard up. And so we must put our backs into it. Don’t worry about it too much, because we won’t fail. But what I tell you is true — from the time I send this letter off until I receive your reply, which I hope will cross this, I have nothing and it’s fasting time again. Anyway — we’ll hope that we’ll be together in a while — and that the worst will be over. Regards, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b496 V/19My dear Theo, I tore up a letter that I wrote to you first, and that’s why you’re receiving my reply a little later. I’ll start by thanking you for the 50 francs. Which I appreciate as, for that matter, I do everything you do for me. But as I started to say, your letter disappoints me since you don’t accede to my request, because I still continue to believe so strongly that the reasons which I gave you in my last letter for preferring to come even sooner were justified. But since I don’t want to argue about that, after all, I just wanted to ask you to reconsider it again. For I keep relapsing; my constitution is still far from strong. And now as regards the cost, I believe it’s six of one and half a dozen of the other. So think it over carefully again. The winter was even harder for him than for me, and the poor devil is in a much worse state than I am, since his age makes it very critical. Regards — but do think about it again carefully; it would greatly reassure me if you could see the matter as I do. Anyway, write to me soon. For my own pleasure I’d rather paint something else, but as far as practical use is concerned, it’s unavoidable. With a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent It’s precisely because I think, after all, that I’ve derived benefit from coming to Antwerp that I believe we should go straight on. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b497 V/19My dear Theo, My health, I fancy, is beginning to improve a little in so far as I’m beginning to be able to digest my food somewhat better. But it’s still uncertain all the same, and one day’s unlike another. You see, since I’ve seen and heard how they set about it from other fellows here who concentrate on the figure — and bear in mind they’re all such as have more to spend than I — they’ve always used the models in some studio or other in town — precisely because of the cost. And this way one gets correction and one sees others working at the same time. I’d be happy to stay if the course at the academy were continuing. Think carefully about whether we couldn’t find a combination that would make it possible for me to be in Paris before June. I’d like it so much, because I believe that it would be better for so many reasons, which I’ve already told you. To which I may also add that it seems to me that we could discuss taking a studio by June so much better if we were both already in Paris beforehand and could size up the pros and cons of the situation. Anyway. Write to me again soon, with a handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b498 V/19My dear Theo, Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b499 V/1962 Vincent did not go to Nuenen from Antwerp, as he had considered doing; instead – apparently without Theo’s knowledge – he went straight to Paris. This must have been influenced by the need to give notice on his room before the start of the new month (March). The note was written after Van Gogh arrived in Paris; he took it for granted that Theo would be able to meet him that same morning. We assume that Vincent wanted to avoid having to spend money on boarding-houses in Antwerp or Paris, and that he had to communicate by note because he was unwilling or unable to speak to Theo straightaway. We have therefore dated the letter on or about Sunday, 28 February 188My dear friend, She claimed that I’d tried to pick a fight — which doesn’t surprise me — knowing that appalling things would be done to her if she took my side. I also saw the waiter on my way in, but he made himself scarce. Now I didn’t want to take the paintings straightaway, but I said that when you got back we’d have a chat about it, because those paintings belonged to you as much as to me, and while waiting I urged her to think again about what had happened. She didn’t know that the waiter had gone up to your place. If that’s true — I would be even more inclined to believe it was more the case that she’d tried to warn me people were trying to pick a fight with me, than that she’d been up to something herself. She can’t do as she’d like. Now I’ll wait till you get back before doing anything. But with all that it isn’t easy to work. What bothered me a bit in this business was that by not going (to the Tambourin) it looked cowardly. And having gone there restored my peace of mind. I shake your hand. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b501 V/1962 Theo’s letter with the money did not contain any news about Jo Bonger’s refusal of his marriage proposal, and was therefore probably sent on 21 July at the latest, so Vincent must have written this by Tuesday, 19 July at the latest. Since Theo must have left around 14 July and this letter was written relatively soon after his departure – Vincent says he hopes Theo will enjoy the visit – we have dated it between about Sunday, 17 and Tuesday, 19 July 1887. Vincent wrote all his previous letters to Theo – with the exception of those from the Borinage – in Dutch; now he switches to French. The reason for this must have been that because they both spent most of their time with French-speakers in Paris, they had become accustomed to communicating in FrencMy dear friend, I thank you for your letter and for what it contained.  I feel sad that even if successful, painting won’t bring in what it costs. I find that terribly true, but on the other hand real love puts you right off art.  And sometimes I already feel old and broken, but still sufficiently in love to stop me being enthusiastic about painting. To succeed you have to have ambition, and ambition seems absurd to me. I don’t know what will come of it. Most of all, I’d like to be less of a burden to you — and that’s not impossible from now on. Because I hope to make progress in such a way that you’ll be able to show what I’m doing, with confidence, without compromising yourself. And then I’m going to retreat to somewhere in the south so as not to see so many painters who repel me as men. In two months she’ll be better, I hope, and then perhaps she’ll be grateful that I didn’t bother her. And if you really fell in love and then got married, I wouldn’t think it impossible that you too might manage to get hold of a house in the country, like so many other picture dealers. If you live well you spend more, but you also gain more ground, and perhaps these days we do better if we look rich than if we look hard up. It’s better to have fun than to kill yourself. Warm regards to all at home. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b502 V/19My dear Theo, But I tell myself that you’ll perhaps come here often yourself later on. It seems to me almost impossible to be able to work in Paris, unless you have a refuge in which to recover and regain your peace of mind and self-composure. Without that, you’d be bound to get utterly numbed. Now I’ll tell you that for a start, there’s been a snowfall of at least 60 centimetres all over, and it’s still snowing. But here in Arles the land seems flat.  I noticed some magnificent plots of red earth planted with vines, with mountains in the background of the most delicate lilac. And the landscape under the snow with the white peaks against a sky as bright as the snow was just like the winter landscapes the Japanese did. Here’s my address Restaurant Carrel 30 rue Cavalerie So far I’ve taken no more than a little walk round the town, as I was more or less completely done in last night. With a good handshake to you and the pals. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b503 V/19My dear Theo, Thanks for your kind letter and the 50-franc note. Don’t worry, and give the pals a handshake for me. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b504 V/1962 Fowle thought it likely that Reid had gone to Marseille himself as early as 1886 or 1887 to look for work by Monticelli, or in any event that he had contacts there (Fowle 1993, p. 36). In view of the Van Gogh brothers’ interest in this artist, Reid evidently saw Vincent’s departure for the south of France as a threat to his monopoly in this fielMy dear Theo, I shake your hand firmly. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b505 V/1962 The Impressionists had been well represented for several years at Les Vingt exhibitions, which drew large crowds. The fifth exhibition of Les Vingt had opened at the beginning of February 1888, with works by Anquetin, Caillebotte, Toulouse-Lautrec, Guillaumin, Signac and others. See exhib. cat. Brussels 1993 and Delevoy 1981, p. 125 ff.My dear Theo With a handshake to you and to any pals you may meet. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b506 V/19My dear Theo, Unfortunately I’m hardly managing to live more cheaply than in Paris, I need to allow 5 francs a day. For the moment I haven’t found anything like a boarding-house, but there must surely be some. If the weather also gets milder in Paris it will do you good. What a winter! I daren’t roll up my studies yet because they’re hardly dry, and there are some areas of impasto that won’t dry for a while. For Christ’s sake, when are we going to see a generation of artists with healthy bodies? Sometimes I’m really furious with myself because it isn’t good enough to be iller or less ill than others, the ideal thing would be to have a strong enough constitution to live for 80 years and along with that, blood that was real good blood. But we could take comfort if we felt that a generation of more fortunate artists was going to come along. I wanted to write to you straightaway that I’m hopeful winter’s over now and I hope it will be the same in Paris. Handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b507 V/1962My dear Theo, Perhaps it would be easier to get a few dealers and art lovers to agree to buy Impressionist paintings than to get the artists to agree to share equally the price of paintings sold. I was obliged to buy supplies for 50 francs when your letter arrived. This week I’ll start work on 4 or 5 things. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b508 V/19My dear Theo, I thank you very much for your letter, which I hadn’t even dared to expect so soon as regards the 50-franc note you included with it. I wouldn’t talk to you about that if it weren’t to tell you that I’ve seen the boulevards of this town full of excited people. And really, that was quite beautiful. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b509 V/1962 For the ‘petits ramoneurs savoyards’ see www.hautesavoiephotos.coMy dear Theo,  And if not, what are his intentions as regards an offensive, do they exist, yes or no? And has he calculated, like us, the effect of a fall on paintings that are highly priced at present, a fall which, it seems to me, will probably come about as soon as the Impressionists rise. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b510 V/1962 On the freedom that the artist has to exaggerate, he says: ‘The novelist who transforms the unchanging, brutal and disagreeable truth in order to extract from it a singular and appealing adventure should, without excessive concern for plausibility, manipulate events as he pleases, and should prepare and organize them so as to please, move or touch the reader’ (Le romancier qui transforme la vérité constante, brutale et déplaisante, pour en tirer une aventure exceptionnelle et séduisante, doit, sans souci exagéré de la vraisemblance, manipuler les événements à son gré, les préparer et les arranger pour plaire au lecteur, l’émouvoir ou l’attendrir). See Maupassant 1987, pp. 708, 706 respectivelMy dear Theo, Your letter gave me great pleasure, I thank you for it as well as for the 50-franc note. I’m convinced there’s nothing hurtful in his silence towards me, in any case he’d have expected you to give me his reply to read. And it’s much more practical for him having only to write to you, and as far as I’m concerned, if he doesn’t think what I’m doing is utterly bad, you’ll see, he’ll write me a line as soon as he’s seen my work. So once again, I’m happier with his simple and friendly reply than I could tell you. I’ll write more in the next few days, but wanted to congratulate you right away on the renewal of your relations with Holland. Handshake. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b511 V/1962 We do not know which of Monticelli’s flower pieces Van Gogh had seen at Delarebeyrette’s; in 1886 the gallery had some forty works by Monticelli in stock. See Alauzen and Ripert 1969, p. 44My dear Theo, However, that one doesn’t count, because I hope you’ll think what I’ve just done is good and that it will mean a new canvas of mine goes off to Holland. Souvenir de Mauve That’s how I feel the thing, no sadder than that.

Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b515 V/19My dear Theo, The air here is definitely doing me good, I could wish you deep lungfuls of it. One of its effects is quite funny, one small glass of cognac goes to my head down here, so without having recourse to stimulants to get my blood circulating, my constitution won’t be taxed so much all the same. But I’ve had a terribly weak stomach since I’ve been here, well, that’s probably a matter of a lot of patience. I hope to make real progress this year, which I really need to do too. Anyway, I’m working hard, hoping we’ll be able to do things of this kind. The month will be hard for you and me, but nevertheless, if you can manage it, it’s to our advantage to do as many orchards in blossom as we can. I’m now well under way and I need 10 more, I think, same subject. You know I’m changeable in my work, and this rage to paint orchards won’t last for ever. After that it may be bullrings. And I have an ENORMOUS amount of drawing to do, because I’d like to do drawings in the style of Japanese prints. I can’t do anything but strike while the iron’s hot. Will be worn out after the orchards, because they’re no. 25 and 30 and 20 canvases. Am quite curious to know what the results will be after a year, I hope by then I’ll be less troubled by fits of faintness. At the moment I suffer a lot some days, but that doesn’t worry me in the least because it’s nothing but the reaction to this past winter, which wasn’t normal. And the blood’s restoring itself, that’s the main thing. We must reach the point where my paintings are worth what I spend and even exceed that, seeing that so much has been spent already. Ah well, we’ll get there. Not everything I do is a success, of course, but the work’s getting along. Up to now you haven’t complained about what I spend here, but let me warn you that if I continue my work at the same rate I’ll find it hard to manage. But the work’s excessive. If it’s possible to manage a bit of a steep month, so much the better, because orchards in blossom are subjects we have a chance of selling or exchanging. But I thought about the fact that you’ll have the rent to pay, and that’s why you must let me know if you’re too hard up. It’s not possible to do both values and colour. You can’t be at the pole and the equator at the same time. You have to choose. And I have high hopes of doing that, too, and it will probably be colour. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b514 a-b V/19My dear Theo, But precisely because what’s in people’s hearts is also the heart of business, we have to conquer friendships in Holland, or rather, revive them. All the more so since, as far as the cause of Impressionism goes, we have little to fear at the moment of not winning through. And it’s because of this victory that’s almost guaranteed in advance that for our part we have to have good manners and do everything calmly. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b516 V/19My dear Theo, 4 tubes of white at 1 franc, but the rest should only be half the price. I find his Prussian blue poor, and his cinnabar. The rest is good. At the moment I’m trying to finish them a little every day, and to make them go together. I’d really like to do this group of 9 canvases. Here’s the other middle piece of the no. 12 canvases. The ground purple — in the background a wall, with straight poplars — and a very blue sky. The small pear tree has a purple trunk and white flowers, a large yellow butterfly on one of the clumps. On the left, in the corner, a little garden with a border of yellow reeds and green bushes and a flowerbed. A small pink house. So there are the details of the decoration of orchards in blossom, which I was intending for you. But the last 3 canvases exist only in a provisional state, and are supposed to represent a very large orchard with a border of cypresses and large pear trees and apple trees. Ever yours, Vincent As soon as the Langlois bridge and the repetition of the other painting (the pink peach tree) are dry, will make a consignment. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b517 V/19My dear Theo, When a man comes out of prison after having spent a long time there, there are times when he even misses prison, because he feels disoriented once he’s at liberty, probably so called because the exhausting daily task of earning one’s living leaves one hardly any liberty. But you know all that. You’ll certainly regret some things without choosing to, even while you gain others. Well then, I’m writing to you in haste, that way you’ll have my letter before you leave if it’s this coming Sunday you plan to go. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b518 a-b V/1962 These artists were in any event very well represented at the Paris World Exhibition of 1889: Benjamin-Constant had ten works there, Lefebvre had nine, Bouguereau had fourteen. See exhib. cat. Paris 1889-3, pp. 2 (cat. nos. 59-68), 4 (cat. nos. 157-166), 18 (cat. nos. 885-893), 45 (cat. nos. 91-94My dear Theo, He’s a Yankee who probably does much better than the ordinary run of Yankees. But a Yankee all the same. Is that saying enough? When I’ve seen his paintings or drawings I’ll concede about the work. But about the man, still the same. The main point of this letter is to know if you’ve left, and how. And after — that — what comes after — you perhaps don’t know yourself. Because I said to myself that a falling-out with those gentlemen could make lower expenses on my part desirable for you. Not being, fortunately for me, one of those people whose only love in this world is paintings. On the contrary, believing that an artistic thing can be made at less cost than a painting requires — I’ve started a series of pen drawings. Being forced, determined anyway, to move, do you want or rather do you think it more suitable, to go to Marseille now? I can do a series of seascapes there like the orchards in blossom series here. And I’ve also bought 3 strong cloth shirts and two pairs of sturdy shoes, with the idea of moving. In Marseille I would be more willing to try to obtain a showcase for the Impressionists, if you for your part would give me an assurance that you’d supply it, this showcase, with Impressionist paintings if people ask you to exhibit them. Which will be easy. So let me know your address in case you travel. When will you be in Holland? Still same address for me but would like to move, as I don’t feel comfortable here. Handshake. Vincent Will be very hard up end of month but should get by, only it’s being able to move right away that bothers me.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b519 V/19My dear Theo, Ah, well — today I rented the right-hand wing of this building, which contains 4 rooms, or more precisely, two, with two little rooms. The drawings, I dare assure you, will become even better. Should it come about that you had to leave those gentlemen, don’t think that I have doubts about the possibility of doing business all the same, but we mustn’t be caught unawares, that’s all, and if it drags on a bit longer that’s actually for the better. And no rice or macaroni either, or else it’s ruined with fat or they don’t do it, and make the excuse: it’s for tomorrow, there’s no room on the stove, &c. It’s silly but true all the same that that’s why my health is poor. All the more reason why we should calmly take care of the quality of the thing and not waste time. And after a few years, I can see the possibility that the capital laid out will come back into our hands, if not in cash, then in value. And now if you agree, I’ll rent or buy furniture for the bedroom. I’ll go and have a look today or tomorrow morning. I’m still convinced that nature here is just what’s needed to do colour. And so it’s more than likely that I won’t move far from here. On the other hand, I have water here. If there happened to be some canvases in your apartment that were in the way, this could always be used as a storeroom, that might become necessary, because you ought not to have mediocre things at your place. I shake your hand firmly, wishing you a year as full of sunshine as the weather here today. Warm regards to Koning. Ever yours, Vincent If you could send me 100 francs next time, I could sleep at the studio as early as this week. I’ll also write you what arrangement the furniture dealer wants to make. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b520 a-b V/19My dear Theo, In — the establishment — I thus also count a complete renewal of all my linen and clothes and shoes. And I would be a different man by the end of the year. My poor friend, our neurosis &c. surely also comes from our rather too artistic way of life — but it’s also a fatal inheritance, since in civilization we go on becoming weaker from generation to generation. Certainly that’s taking the bull by the horns, which isn’t a bad policy. Ever yours, Vincent (It goes without saying that if at your home there were canvases that were taking up too much space you could send them here by goods train and I’d keep them in the studio here. If that isn’t yet the case it will be later, so I keep quite a few studies here that don’t seem good enough to me to be sent to you.) Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b521 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I’m writing you another line to tell you that on reflection I think the best thing will be quite simply to take a mat and a mattress and make a bed in the studio on the floor. Because for the whole summer it’s going to be so hot it’ll be more than enough like that. Then in the winter we could see if we’ll need to take a bed, yes or no. This painter of the future, I can’t imagine him living in small restaurants, working with several false teeth and going into Zouave brothels like me. I’m very keen to see something of that for myself, but for the very reason that I don’t want to get all worked up I’ll do it when my nerves are settled. That I saw all that as involuntary acts (and him not responsible, therefore, and to be forgiven for these acts) of an over-excited nervous system. Ever yours, Vincent I’ve seen a whole lot of crates for my consignment at the penny bazaar, I’ll go back to take measurements. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b522 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I like to think it’s not true. Have you heard about it? I’ll send you those 5 small drawings today, to Brussels. And I hope that later on, other artists will emerge in this beautiful part of the country. To do here what the Japanese have done in their country. And working at that isn’t so bad. And the address from now on will be place Lamartine 2 I hope — and I have no doubts — that when you get back to Paris it will finally be spring. And not before time, for Heaven’s sake. Living at the hotel you never make progress, and now at the end of a year I’ll have furniture &c. that will belong to me, and while that wouldn’t be worthwhile if I was in the south for only a few months, it’s quite another matter once it’s a question of a long stay. And I have no doubts that I’ll always love nature here, it’s something like Japanese art, once you love that you don’t have second thoughts about it. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b523 V/19My dear Theo. I’m writing to you again today because, when I wanted to pay my bill at the hotel where I’m staying, I realized once again that I was being fleeced there. I offered to come to some arrangement with them, they weren’t willing to, so when I wanted to take my things they prevented me. So I wanted to ask you to put me in a position where I could buy my mattress anyway. Since I’m feeling better now I really don’t consider myself defeated, and besides, if I’d had my health, which I hope to get back here, that and many other things wouldn’t happen to me. All the same, I had intended to stay with these people until I was ready. Well, it doesn’t matter. I still want to try and get my crate sent off today. I hope you’ll write soon. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b524 V/19My dear Theo, For the time being I have to pay my bill, but at the same time it’s stated on the receipt that this payment is only to recover possession of my things, and that the inflated bill will be submitted to the justice of the peace. But with all that I have practically nothing left, I bought what I need to make a little coffee or broth at home, and two chairs and a table. That means I have just 15 francs left. So I’m asking you to send me some more money no later than when you get back to Paris, in any case. I regret not having taken this studio sooner. With what those people overcharged me I could already have furnished it. But I really count on it I’ve now paid my dues to misfortune and it’s better that should come at the beginning than at the end of the expedition. I feel sure I’ll soon have several new canvases on the easel. My consignment is packed up and will go off today. And we’ll put an end to that. I’ll make a studio here that will last, and where if need be we can fit another painter in. Foreigners are exploited here and — for their part, the people around here aren’t wrong — it’s considered a duty to get all you can out of them. And it’s better to work hard and spend more, if it’s absolutely necessary. If you put aside what’s best in the consignment — and if you were to think of these paintings as a payment on my part to be deducted from what I owe you — And if we had 50 like that put aside, then I’d breathe a bit more  easily. Anyway — write to me soon. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b525 V/19My dear Theo, First I had an absolutely consuming period of work and then I was so worn out and ill that I didn’t feel I had the strength to go and live on my own — and I’ve put up with things too much, for their present bill they’re basing themselves on a period when I was paying them more (when I was ill and had asked them for better wine). In short, I believe I’m a worker and not a soft foreign tourist here to enjoy himself, and it would be lack of energy on my part to let myself be exploited like that. So I’m starting to set up a studio that may at the same time be of use to our pals, if they come, or if there are painters here. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b526 V/19My dear Theo, My health’s been better these days. Now I have two new studies like this: If they don’t mow the meadow I’d like to do this study again, because the subject matter was really beautiful and I had trouble finding the composition. A little town surrounded by countryside entirely covered in yellow and purple flowers. That would really be a Japanese dream, you know. Having asked the price for sending the consignment that went off by goods train, it will be 7 francs at the station in Paris. As I don’t have very much left I didn’t put postage on it here — but if they asked more you’d have to complain. The crate is marked UV and W1042. Handshake, write to me soon. Ever yours,  Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b527 V/1962 The inhabitants of Tarascon are described in the novel as gullible people with vivid imaginations. Their favourite occupations are hunting – in the absence of game they shoot at their caps – and singing love songs. Because Tartarin excels in both pursuits he is very highly regarded. He likes bragging about his long voyages, but in fact he has never been outside Tarascon. To maintain his reputation he goes to Algeria to hunt lions, has all sorts of adventures, shoots a solitary (tame) lion and is greeted as a hero on his return to TarasconMy dear Theo, Thanks for your letter containing 100 francs. I’m very glad to have left those people’s place, and my health is much better since. It was their bad food more than anything that made it drag on, and their wine, which was real poison. I now eat very well for one franc or 1.50 francs. To find plenty of subjects is perhaps already something in itself. Provided the paintings are worth what they cost. If the Impressionists go up in value that may become the case. And after a few years’ work we could recoup the past to some extent. And after a year I’ll have a quiet home of my own. I’m curious about what you’ll say about my consignment, I think it takes 10 days to go from here to Paris by goods train. If the consignment includes some that are too poor, don’t show them. The reason I sent you the whole lot is that it will give you an idea of the things I’ve seen. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b528 V/19My dear Theo, And it will in any case — I have no doubt about it — be your intention to be friends with both the one and the other. This week I’ve done two still lifes. For myself, I feel infinitely better, my blood is circulating well, and my stomach’s digesting. I’ve found very, very good food now, which had an immediate effect on me. I still haven’t been able to make a deal with the furniture dealer, I’ve seen a bed but it’s dearer than I thought. I feel the need to get more work done before spending more on furniture. I’ve bought some very strong linen. And we, who, I’m inclined to believe, are by no means so close to dying, nevertheless feel the thing is bigger than us and longer-lasting than our lives. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b529 a-c V/1962 It seems obvious that Van Gogh painted this still life and the one referred to below on 16 and 17 May, because it rained on those days and he could not work outdoors (Météo-FranceMy dear Theo, Anyway, there’s no serious harm done. I plan to do a lot more drawing. It’s already jolly hot, I can assure you. I’ll also divide the order into two according to what would be more urgent or less. What’s always urgent is to draw, and whether it’s done directly with a brush, or with something else, such as a pen, you never do enough. I’m trying now to exaggerate the essence of things, and to deliberately leave vague what’s commonplace. Ever yours, Vincent I hope to have news from you tomorrow, otherwise I’d be in quite a tight corner as I only have money left for tomorrow, Sunday. Have you received the crate at long last? It doesn’t much surprise me that it takes time, though, as the crate had to be transported from one station to another — but — all the same. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b530 V/1962 Van Gogh enclosed a paint order which has not survived.My dear Theo I’ve got them to agree to repaint the house, the front, the doors and the windows outside and inside. Only I have to pay 10 francs for that myself. But I think it will be well worth the bother. I hope you’ll have as fine a Sunday in Paris as here — there’s splendid sunshine and no wind. Write to me at once, I’ve no money left at all. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b531 V/19My dear Theo, I was very pleased to receive this morning’s letter from you; I thank you very much for the 100-franc note that was included in it. And am glad in the end that the crate has arrived. And I blame myself for wearing you out like this — me — with my constant needs for money. But to go and pull the chestnuts out of the fire for those gentlemen in the state you’re in now is to spend a year that will wear you out. And that does nobody any good. My dear brother — the Muslim idea that death only comes when it must come — let’s just see about that. To me, it seems that we haven’t any proof of such a direct guidance from above. On the contrary, it seems to me that it’s been proved that good hygiene may not only prolong life but above all, can make it more serene — its waters more limpid — while poor hygiene not only muddies life’s current, but even more than that, lack of hygiene may put an end to life before time.  Would you like me to go to America with you? It would be only right that those gentlemen paid my fare. There are many things that wouldn’t matter to me one way or the other, but not that — that you didn’t first build up your health properly. Now I think you need to immerse yourself again even more, both in nature and among artists. Good, do the same if you have comparable capacities. I’m not against it, and our family has a tenacious grip on life. Everything I could wish to say is summed up in this: if those gentlemen make you pull the chestnuts out of the fire over such distances, see that you’re well paid, or refuse, and throw yourself into the Impressionists, doing less business from the point of view of the sums handled, but living closer to nature. For myself, I’m definitely recovering, and since the past month my stomach has improved enormously. I still suffer from unaccountable, involuntary feelings, or a stupor on some days, but it’s getting calmer. I’d like everybody to come here to the south too. I’m always blaming myself for the fact that my painting isn’t worth what it costs. We must work nevertheless — but you should know that if circumstances ever made it desirable for me to involve myself more in business, as long as it took a burden off you, I’d do it with no regrets. Do you know what we should do with these drawings? Albums of 6 or 10 or 12, like the albums of original Japanese drawings. Ever yours, Vincent You should know that I’d rather give up my painting than see you wear yourself out to earn money. We need it of course, but have we reached the point where we have to go and look for it so far away? You see so clearly that ‘preparing oneself for death’, a Christian idea — (fortunately for him Christ himself didn’t share it at all, it seems to me — he who loved the people and things of this earth, more than is wise according to those who see him as nothing more than a crackpot), if — you see so clearly that preparing oneself for death is a thing — to leave there for what it is — don’t you also see that — devotion — living for others — is a mistake if it’s complicated by suicide — since in that case one truly makes murderers of one’s friends. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b532 a-c V/1962 In the Van Gogh Museum collection there is a Japanese album of prints that comes from the family estate and was made in the way Van Gogh illustrated in his sketch: Shinsen kachō no kei (Glimpses of newly selected flowers and birds). See cat Amsterdam 1991, p. 25 and cat. no. 11My dear Theo, And the two of us will live on the same money as I spend on myself alone. You know I’ve always thought it ridiculous for painters to live alone &c. You always lose when you’re isolated. Well, it’s in response to your wish to help him out. As long as we didn’t exceed that amount, wouldn’t there even be a benefit? Besides, I’m speculating about joining forces with others. I thought that you had a wish to come to his aid, as I suffer myself at the thought that he’s in a tight corner — something that won’t change overnight. We can’t offer better than that, and others wouldn’t do as much. For my part, it worries me to spend so much on myself alone, but to find a remedy for that there’s none other than that of finding a wife with money or pals who associate with one another for paintings. Now I don’t see the wife, but I do see the pals. If that suited him, wouldn’t do to keep him waiting. Ever yours, Vincent You have to think it over very, very, very carefully before starting to travel. It seems so likely to me that your job is to stay in France. I’ve thought of you very often and if I’m only writing now it’s because I didn’t want to write empty phrases. So I’ve very often thought about talking to you about it straight out.  You know that my brother and I have a high regard for your painting and that we’d very much wish to know you were a little at your ease. But all the same, my brother can’t send money to you in Brittany and at the same time money to me in Provence. But would you like to share with me here? Then by joining forces, there would perhaps be enough for two; I’m sure of it, even. Having once attacked the south, I see no reason to give it up. Living here seems more expensive, though, but isn’t it also the case that the opportunities for gaining paintings are greater? In any event, if my brother were to send us 250 francs a month for both of us, would you like to come, and we would share. But in that case we’d have to make up our minds to eat at home as much as possible; we’d take on some kind of charwoman for a few hours a day, avoiding all the costs of a hotel that way. And you would give my brother one painting a month, while you’d be free to do whatever you liked with the rest. Now the two of us would start exhibiting in Marseille straightaway, thus opening the way for other Impressionists as well as for ourselves. He’ll just assure you that the only means we’ve found up to now of helping you in a more practical way would be this arrangement, if it suits you. We’ve thought about it a good deal. It seems to me that what you need for your health’s sake is peace and quiet above all. If I’m wrong, and if the heat in the south turned out to be too much — well — we’d have to see. For myself, so far I feel very well in this climate. There’s plenty more I could tell you — but here we are, business first. Reply to both of us soon. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b533 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b535 V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, I’m taking everything I need in order to draw, especially. I have to draw a lot, for the very reason you were speaking of in your last letter — things here have so much style. And I want to arrive at a more deliberate and exaggerated way of drawing. I’m still a little worried about your plans for travelling, or rather, the proposals about travelling they’re putting to you. Travelling wears you out, and most of all, it unsettles the brain more than can be good for you. In any case, I’d feel it was my fault, telling myself that it’s my needs for money that are driving you to it. No — it’s not good. We have to count on it taking years, perhaps, before Impressionist paintings have a firm value, and so to help him we’ll have to see it as a long-term business. But he has such a fine talent, an association with him would be a step forward for us. I told you very seriously that if you wish, I’ll go to America with you, if, though, this journey was a long one and if it’s worth the trouble. But we’re alone there with our thoughts and would sometimes wish to be stupid. Given the bodies we have, we need to live with pals. Handshake, and many thanks for the colours. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b536 V/19My dear Theo, I’m writing to you from Saintes-Maries on the Mediterranean at last — the Mediterranean — has a colour like mackerel, in other words, changing — you don’t always know if it’s green or purple — you don’t always know if it’s blue — because a second later, its changing reflection has taken on a pink or grey hue. The beach here is sandy, no cliffs or rocks — like Holland — without the dunes and with more blue. I don’t believe there are 100 houses in this village or town. But I expect to come back here. Next week I’d like to go to Tarascon to do two or three studies. If you haven’t already written I’ll expect your letter in Arles, of course. Next month will be the public bathing season. Number of bathers varies from 20 to 50. I took a walk along the seashore one night, on the deserted beach. It wasn’t cheerful, but not sad either, it was — beautiful. More soon, I hope. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b540 V/1962My dear Theo, Many thanks for your kind letter and the 50-franc note that was enclosed with it. Now that I’ve seen the sea here I really feel the importance there is in staying in the south and feeling — if the colour has to be even more exaggerated — Africa not far away from one. It was before the boats cleared off; I’d watched it all the other mornings, but as they leave very early, hadn’t had time to do it. But it’s a very good sign that the young ones are furious, perhaps it proves that there are some old ones who’ve spoken well of it. About staying in the south, even if it’s more expensive — Look, we love Japanese painting, we’ve experienced its influence — all the Impressionists have that in common — and we wouldn’t go to Japan, in other words, to what is the equivalent of Japan, the south? So I believe that the future of the new art still lies in the south after all. What have you decided about our two sisters? More soon, handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b541 V/1962My dear Theo — Do you know that at Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b534 V/1962 Vincent enclosed a letter to Gauguin for Theo to send on to hiMy dear Theo, On Monday morning I received your telegraphed money order for 50 francs, for which I thank you kindly. But I haven’t yet received your letter, which surprised me a little. I shouldn’t be surprised if that hope is a fata Morgana, a mirage that goes with being broke. The more broke you are — especially when you’re ill — the more you think of such possibilities. I haven’t left for Saintes-Maries — they’ve finished painting the house and I had to pay, and I also have to buy quite a considerable supply of canvas.  I still continue to find the subjects here very beautiful and interesting, and despite the vexations of expenses, I nevertheless think there’s a better chance in the south than in the north. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b537 V/19My dear Theo, I’m writing you another line because I haven’t yet received your letter. But I presume you’ll have said to yourself that I would probably be at Saintes-Maries. As the rent for the house and the painting of the doors and windows and the purchase of canvases have all come together and drained me dry, you’ll do me a very great service by sending me some money a few days early.  It’s quite hard for me to imagine myself changing direction; having made a start on the south it’s better not to move than — penetrating ever deeper into the region. I believe I have more chance of succeeding in doing things — even business affairs — that are a bit larger, than if I hold back and do them too small. Those cost me 4 francs each here and that isn’t dear, considering the transport. It must be in the drawing. So perhaps, perhaps, I’m on the right track and my eye’s adapting to nature here. Let’s wait a little longer to be sure. Handshake, I hope you’ll be able to write in the very next few days. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b538 V/19My dear Theo, And I categorically withdraw from it, and the only question for me remains quite simply this: If I looked for a pal to work with, would I be doing the right thing, would this be more beneficial to my brother and me, would the pal lose or would he gain by it? So these, then, are questions that certainly preoccupy me, but which need to come face to face with reality in order to become actual facts. Well then — on days when I bring back a study I say to myself, if it was like this every day things could work — but on days when you come home empty-handed and you eat and spend money all the same, you don’t feel content with yourself, and you feel like a madman, a scoundrel or an old fool. Ever yours, Vincent The most radical thing we could do would be for me to give up the south, and if that would get him out of trouble, go and join him in Brittany myself. And the desire I have to work in the south is naturally subordinate to the interests of people like him. All the same, we shouldn’t change lightly.  And I’m a little afraid of getting a dressing-down for having separated him from his family, or a hornet’s nest like that. If now I haven’t mentioned these two passages and other passages in his letter it’s because it seems far too difficult to me to say yes to that in all honesty. However, if it was the case that his whole plan is nothing but a fata Morgana, and as such will vanish, he’ll speak of it again of his own accord. You know I feel so well now that it isn’t indispensable that I stay here for my health alone. We have to act so that you aren’t completely overwhelmed by expenses, that’s what’s necessary and that’s serious enough in itself.  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b539 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b578 V/1962 (sheet 2) We have taken the fact that the accompanying letter – the second sheet discussed here – has no salutation or signature as a reason to regard it as an addition to the present letter. The assumption is that Vincent would have opened and closed his accompanying letter with a salutation and a signature had he sent Theo the letter for Gauguin separately. This cannot be established with absolute certainty; it remains conceivable that the letter for Gauguin was sent to Theo with a sheet as an accompanying letter without the usual formalities, because its imminent arrival had been announced shortly before. Macknight left Paris in the spring of 1886. He headed first for the south of France and later that year for the Algerian oasis of Ghardaia. See Bailey 2007, p. 3My dear Theo, And the sketch as such — a no. 25 canvas — also worries me a lot, in the sense that I wonder whether I shouldn’t take it seriously and make a tremendous painting out of it. My God, how I’d love to do that. But I just wonder whether I’ll have the necessary power of execution. I’m putting the sketch aside just as it is, hardly daring to think about it. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if it was very beautiful. The canvas isn’t at all urgent either. I should in any case not like to diminish an individual through an association, and if he feels the desire to try this affair in question he may have his reasons and I wouldn’t like to deflect him from it if in fact he were to be keen on it. Which remains to be seen and which will perhaps emerge from his reply. More soon, I hope. Handshake, and thanks for the newspaper, and great success with your exhibition. Yours truly, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b542 V/19My dear Theo, I’m really unhappy with what I’ve done these past few days, because it’s very ugly. And yet the figure interests me much more than landscape.  To do studies of figures, to attempt them and to learn would still after all be the shortest route for me to do something of value. It’s still raining a lot here, which does a lot of damage to the wheat, which is still standing. But luckily I had a model these past few days. The rest, the hope of doing better, is also a bit of a fata Morgana. Well, there’s not much remedy for all that, unless some day or other one could enter into an association with a good worker and produce more together. To work quickly isn’t to work less seriously, it depends on the confidence and experience one has. What amazes me is how few flowers there are, so no cornflowers in the wheatfields, seldom any poppies. What was the cost of the carriage for the crate of pictures recently? The impastos on some canvases are dry on the surface but not enough to roll them up; if it wasn’t for that I’d send them.

With a look that displays All of a heart’s wretchedness, Each woman, as if at market, Meat dressed with a flower, Decked out in silk and gold, Sells her poor resigned soul. II Society, behold your crime. Man, cast a lenient glance Upon the whore, this victim. Woman, who knows full well that everything is a lie, Longing for nothing now, Not even the end of life, Who sees only a great emptiness Round all her being and her soul, Love’s sad victim! – Society, you are wicked When, for your own Desire, you force  Children under Pleasure’s yoke. 19 June 1888. I C’est dans un coin très retiré Un cabaret sombre qu’attriste Le jour bas d’un volet tiré. La marchande est specialiste Et vend comme en un débit clair De la boisson et de la chair... Avec un regard où s’étale Toute la misère d’un coeur Chaque femme comme à la halle La viande qu’habille une fleur Dans la soie et l’or bien peignée Vend sa pauvre âme résignée II Société voici ton crime. Homme jette un regard clément Sur la putain, cette victime. Femme qui sait bien que tout ment A qui plus rien ne fait envie Pas même la fin de la vie, Qui ne voit qu’un grand vide autour De tout son être et de son âme Triste victime de l’amour! – Société tu es infâme Quand tu courbes pour ton Désir Des enfants au joug du Plaisir. 19 Juin 1888. Although Van Gogh talks about ‘sonnets’, strictly speaking this is not what they are. Cf. exhib. cat. New Brunswick 1988, p. 2My dear Theo, Having recently bought some canvases from which I’ll keep the stretching frames, it’s a big saving. I must warn you that everyone will find that I work too quickly. Don’t you believe a word of it. I don’t yet have half of the 50 canvases fit to be presented in public, and I need all of them by the end of this year. I also know that I very much hope to stick to my argument of the past winter, when we talked about an association of artists. Not that I still have a great desire or hope to bring it about, but as it was a serious argument, we have to retain our seriousness and retain the right to come back to it, to this question. This prospect only mildly frightens me. If my health doesn’t let me down I’ll do a whole heap of my canvases and out of that lot there’ll be some that will do. Soon I’ll send you some rolled canvases, and the rest as and when it’s possible to roll them up. And I only just have time to prepare myself for the new campaign, the one on the vineyards. And between the two I’d like to do some more seascapes. And that for these arrangements, even if they’d involve my moving, I’m prepared. Two people who get along don’t spend — and even three — much more than one. No more on colours, either. This for sooner or later. And as long as I’m as strong as the others. You can be sure of this, that it would be hard for us to be deceived, seeing that if they make difficulties about working, I know those difficulties too. And I’d perhaps know what it was all about. Now, we’d have a perfect right — and perhaps even a duty — to urge them to work. And that’s what we have to do. If I’m alone, my word, I can’t do anything about that — then I have less need for company than for frantic work, and that’s why I’m boldly ordering canvas and paints. And so I only feel life when I’m working at full stretch. And in company I’d feel a bit less need to do that, or rather, I’d work on more complicated things. And so the canvases I bought here really not so long ago are almost all covered. When I send you the rolled up canvases you could perhaps take quite a few unimportant things off their stretching frames. Handshake to you, and to the pals if you see any of them. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b545 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I’m hurrying to send you back the letter as it is. Yesterday and today I worked on the sower, which has been completely reworked. Ever yours, Vincent Many thanks for the colours — more soon. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b544 V/19My dear Theo, Afterwards — the only thing that comforts and distracts — in my case — as in others, is to stun oneself by taking a stiff drink or smoking very heavily. But during the harvest my work has been no easier than that of the farmers themselves who do this harvesting. Far from my complaining about it, it’s precisely at these moments in artistic life, even if it’s not the real one, that I feel almost as happy as I could be in the ideal, the real life. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b548 V/1962 Vincent thanks Theo for the 50 francs he sent. This must have been the first instalment of the allowance for July, since in his letter of 5 July Vincent refers to the recent consignment of paint from Tasset which he says in the present letter he has ‘just’ received. For this reason we date the letter on or about Sunday, 1 July 188My dear Theo, When I came here I had hoped it would be possible to create art lovers here — so far, I haven’t made a centimetre’s progress into people’s hearts. Now Marseille? I don’t know, but that could well be nothing but an illusion. In any case, I’ve rather stopped speculating about it. So, many days pass without my saying a word to anyone except to order supper or a coffee. And it’s been like that from the start. But up until now loneliness hasn’t bothered me very much, I’ve found the stronger sunshine and its effect on nature so interesting. Write to me a day or two earlier if you can; the end of the week will be a bit tight. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b549 V/19My dear Theo, But I say to myself that if I manage to do 50 studies at 100 francs this year I shall in a certain sense not have done a great injustice by eating and drinking as if that was a right. Now that’s a bit steep, because although at this moment I have about thirty painted studies, I don’t reckon them all at that price. I go without many things — not that I consider that a misfortune, but I consider that my money that I’ll need in future depends to some extent on the vigour of my efforts at present. I say to myself that if the studies are hard to dry here in the heat, they’d be all the harder to dry at your place. And that’s making me delay the consignment. I scraped it off because I tell myself it’s wrong to do figures of that importance without a model. And the same throughout the year, for the harvest, for the vineyards, for everything. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b546 a-b V/1962   It may be Nephtalie Lévy; he and Daniel Dubuffet together took over the management in December 1892 when Maison Bing became Dubuffet & Cie (Ancienne Maison Bing et Cie). See exhib. cat. Amsterdam 2004-1, p. 2My dear Theo, I think the heat is still doing me good, in spite of the mosquitoes and flies. The cicadas — not those at home but like this, I’ve written to Russell that for our exchange I’d send him my consignment rolled up, straight to his home, if I knew he was in Paris. This way he should in any case reply to me in the next few days. Because I’m afraid of wasting paint, I often spoil a painted study. Painters — to speak only of them — being dead and buried, speak to a following generation or to several following generations through their works. Is that all, or is there more, even? In the life of the painter, death may perhaps not be the most difficult thing. Why, I say to myself, should the spots of light in the firmament be less accessible to us than the black spots on the map of France. To die peacefully of old age would be to go there on foot. For the moment I’m going to go to bed because it’s late, and I wish you good-night and good luck. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b547 a-b V/1962My dear Theo How I’d make a painting of it if there wasn’t this bloody wind! That’s the thing that’s annoying here when you plant your easel somewhere. And it’s definitely for that reason that the painted studies aren’t as finished as the drawings. The canvas shakes all the time. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b550 V/1962 ‘The description of the cloister or pagoda where there’s nothing’ refers to chapter 40, where it says that the monks’ cells are completely empty, with just a few unframed sketches on the walls: ‘nothing else, no seats, no cushions, no furniture. It is the ultimate in desired simplicity, in elegance crafted from nothing’ (rien de plus; pas de sièges, pas de coussins, pas de meubles. C’est le comble de la simplicité cherchée, de l’élégance faite avec du néant) (Loti 1990, pp. 172-173). Van Gogh’s fascination with the Japanese approach to art derives from the following passage: ‘For he who has a few notions of Japanese style, my mother-in-law’s interior will reveal to him alone a refined person; total starkness, just two or three little screens placed here and there – a teapot, a vase containing lotus flowers, nothing else ... There are little hiding places everywhere, small niches and cupboards, ingeniously and unexpectedly hidden behind the immaculate uniformity of white paper panels ... In France, we have objets d’art to enjoy them; here they shut them away, neatly labelled in a sort of mysterious, underground apartment, with iron gratings, which is called a godoun’ (Pour qui a quelques notions de japonerie, l’intérieur de ma belle-mère révèle à lui seul une personne raffinée: nudité complète; à peine deux ou trois petits paravents posés çà et là, – une théière, un vase où trempent des lotus; rien de plus ... Il y a partout des petites cachettes, des petites niches, des petits placards, dissimulés de la manière la plus ingénieuse et la plus inattendue sous l’uniformité immaculée des panneaux de papier blanc ... En France, on a des objets d’art pour en jouir; ici, pour les enfermer, bien étiquetés, dans une sorte d’appartement mystérieux, souterrain, grillé en fer, qu’on appelle godoun) (Loti 1990, chapter 35, p. 157My dear Theo, One Sunday he’ll let you choose for yourself, so take plenty of old sheets too. When I was in Paris I always hoped to have a showroom of my own in a café; you know that that fell through. Ever yours, Vincent Write me a short line to tell me if the drawings reach you in good condition. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b551 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Fortunately, we know more about the French Japanese, the Impressionists. That’s definitely the essence and the main thing. So Japanese art, properly speaking, already with its place in collections, already impossible to find in Japan itself, is becoming of secondary interest. That has little or nothing to do with the stock, properly speaking, which may as well stay as it is. Because I don’t tire of those figures and landscapes. And he has so many of them! If I wasn’t so caught up and absorbed in work, how I’d like to sell all that lot! There’s not much to be earned from it, and that’s why nobody takes it up. Nevertheless, after a few years it will all become quite rare, will be sold more dearly. It’s for that reason that we shouldn’t scorn the small advantage that we have at present, of going through thousands to make our choice. So I urge you, keep the advantages of the stock and don’t get rid of the fine sheets; on the contrary, we profit by adding to them. Let’s continue in the same way. It has already been a great regret to me, who knows something about the lot, not to have paid at New Year myself, and chosen the new stock myself. Because you’re dazzled, there’s so much of it. Anyway, that’s perfectly natural, and the difficulty of working in Paris. But let’s not forget that the earth’s a planet too, therefore a star or celestial globe. And what if all these other stars were the same!!!!!! It wouldn’t be very jolly, in fact you’d have to start all over again. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b552 a-b V/19My dear Theo Nothing would make it easier for us to place our canvases than to get them widely accepted as decorations in bourgeois homes. As in Holland in the old days. However — cafés — perhaps we’ll decorate them later on. More soon, handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b553 V/1962 Each line is preceded by a bracket: ‘bande blanc et jaune citron bande violette. bande orangé et vert bleu et vert jaune à gauche fleurs rouges, à droite vigne’. (white and lemon yellow stripe violet stripe orange and green stripe blue and green-yellow red flowers on the left, vine on the righMy dear Theo, My painter’s fingers are loosening up, though, just at the very time my carcass is breaking down. And your head as a dealer, a salesman, another trade that takes long to learn, is gaining in experience. I’m ageing faster than you, and what I’m striving for is to be less of a burden to you. Now as far as that goes, if not too monumental a catastrophe occurs, and if it doesn’t rain toads, I hope to achieve that. I’ve just taken thirty or so painted studies off their stretching frames. It’s only cost me my broken-down carcass — my mind pretty well cracked as far as living as I could and should goes — living like a philanthropist. It’s only cost you, let’s say, around fifteen thousand francs that you’ve advanced me. Now — —.. there’s no reason to make monkeys of us. But you’re right not to contradict the powers that be (what powers!). If he guarantees me a cheaper life in Brittany — A lot of painting, few expenses is the course we must take. This to repeat once again that I put aside any preference for either the north or the south. All the plans we make have deep-rooted difficulties behind them. If I thought about, if I dwelled on the disastrous possibilities, I could do nothing — I throw myself into work with abandon, I re-emerge from it with my studies; if the storm within roars too loudly, I drink a glass too many to stun myself. My attention is becoming more intense, my hand steadier. And that’s why I dare almost give you an assurance that my painting will become better. Because that’s all I have left. If only I could find that, and not be such a burden on you. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b554 a-b V/1962 In the same diary entry, they said of Dupré’s patron: ‘Went to Isle-Adam to see the beautiful and curious collection of modern landscapes belonging to the coach-builder Charles Binder ... Stocky, newly rich and middle-class, he has tried, quite intelligently, to ennoble himself through his collection, artistic taste, his relationship with Jules Dupré’ (Été voir à Isle-Adam la belle et curieuse collection de paysages modernes du carrossier Charles Binder ... Un bourgeois râblé et enrichi, qui a essayé, assez intelligemment, de s’anoblir avec une collection, des goûts artistiques, une liaison avec Jules Dupré) (Goncourt 1887-1906, vol. 3, pp. 56-57). Binder, a Parisian coach-builder, had bought a country estate in Isle-Adam in 1853. His picture gallery, with work by Dupré, Corot and Rousseau, was famous. See Blanche Vogt, L’Isle-Adam, perle de L’Ile de France. Paris 1953, p. 4My dear Theo, How is yours? Would it be possible for me to have your letter on Sunday? I’m not counting on it, though, knowing that it’s the end of the month. I have a really great need for some studies of figures. At the moment I have something like an exhibition at my place, in the sense that I’ve taken all the studies off the stretching frames and have nailed them to the wall to finish drying. You’ll see that when there’s a large number of them, and we make a choice among them, it will come to the same thing as if I’d studied them more and worked on them longer. Because to do a subject over and over again on the same canvas or on several canvases comes, in short, to the same degree of seriousness. I’m somewhat rushed, so handshake and  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b556 V/19My dear Theo, Now you talk about the emptiness you sometimes feel; that’s just the same thing that I have, too. Considering, if you will, the times in which we live as a true and great revival of art, the moth-eaten and official tradition, which is still on its feet, but which is at bottom powerless and bone-idle, the new painters, alone, poor, treated like madmen and as a result of this treatment becoming so in fact, at least as far as their social life is concerned.  If a painter ruins his character by working hard at painting, which makes him sterile for many things, for family life, &c. &c. If as a consequence he paints not only with paint but with self-denial and self-abnegation and a broken heart. Not only are you not paid for your own work either, but it costs you exactly the same as this effacement of personality, half deliberate, half accidental, costs a painter. Ever yours, Vincent The portrait of a young girl is on a white background strongly tinted with Veronese green, the bodice is striped blood-red and purple. The skirt is royal blue with large orange-yellow stippling. The matt areas of flesh are yellow grey, the hair purplish, the eyebrows black, and the eyelashes, the eyes orange and Prussian blue; a sprig of oleander between the fingers, because the 2 hands are included. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b555 a-b V/1962My dear Theo, So we’re right to attach ourselves more to artists than to paintings. When I write to him at the same time as I send the drawings, naturally it will be to get him to make up his mind. I’m very curious to know if you were able to go to Holland, yes or no. For the moment I won’t write any more. The change that I’m going to try to make in my paintings will be to do more figures. However, it’s above all a question of trying to see them while they’re still there. It would be so simple and would explain so well the horrors of life that now amaze us and distress us so if life had another, second hemisphere, invisible, it’s true, but where we arrive when we breathe our last. To those who are making this interesting and solemn journey, our best wishes and our best sympathies. Ever yours, Vincent I still have to thank you for yesterday’s 50-franc note, and reply to your letter. Handshake, because if I want to write more to Holland I’ll have to hurry. I’ll have difficulty getting all the way through this week. But I hope to get started on the series of figures. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b557 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I’m more or less assuming that you went to Holland. From the letter received from our sister I’m somewhat inclined to believe they were expecting you in Holland, also because I haven’t had news from you on this subject. It’s very fine, and quite what I wanted. If I did a portrait or just something that I’m determined should last, he could depend on my using it. There’s no better or shorter way to improve my work than to do figures. Also, I always feel confidence when doing portraits, knowing that that work is much more serious — that’s perhaps not the word — but rather is the thing that enables me to cultivate what’s best and most serious in me. More soon, good handshake. Ever yours, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b558 V/1962 Van Gogh says that he had not been able to pay his rent on the first of the month and that his landlord would be coming back on the following Monday (that must have been 6 August). The letter was therefore written between these two dates. Accordingly we have dated it on or about Friday, 3 August 188My dear Theo, I have no more canvas or paint and have already had to buy here. And I have to get even more. So I beg you to send your letter so that I have it on Saturday morning. All these things, family, native country, are perhaps more appealing in the imagination of such as us — who do fairly well without a native country, as well as a family — than in any reality. It always seems to me that I’m a traveller who’s going somewhere and to a destination. If I say to myself, the somewhere, the destination don’t exist at all, that seems well argued and truthful to me. But is that all? so? Seeing that it appears that it is precisely the most worn-out people who feel the germ of this indefinable hope. Are they, the brothel-keepers, always in the right? It’s probable. What to choose, then? Fortunately we don’t have to choose. Handshake and Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b559 V/19My dear Theo, If the drawings that I send you are too stiff, it’s because I did them in such a way as to be able later, if they’re still there, to use them as information for painting. I’m counting on having your letter on Saturday morning. I’ve bought two more canvases, so I now have just 5 francs left, and it’s already Wednesday evening. There would certainly be the possibility of a school of painting here. But you’ll say that nature is beautiful everywhere if one goes into it deeply enough. I’ve been very, very well these last few days; in the long run I believe that I’ll belong to these parts in all respects. Ah, these farmhouse gardens with the lovely big red Provence roses, the vines, the fig trees; it’s quite poetic, and the eternal strong sun, in spite of which the foliage stays very green. The tank, out of which clear water flows that irrigates the farm through channels forming a little canal system. An old, pure white Camargue horse drives the machinery. No cows on these little farms. It’s THE ONLY genuinely practical book that I know, and I know a little from experience how useful it is. One in particular, in white-black-pink. Hoping to have news from you soon. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b560 a-b V/19My dear Theo, The fact remains that provided we lived in harmony and with an understanding not to quarrel, we’d gain a firmer position as far as reputation goes.  Each of us living alone, we live like madmen or criminals, in appearance at least, and to some extent in reality, too. I’m happier to feel my old strength coming back than I would have thought I could be. I owe that largely to the people at the restaurant where I eat these days, who are extraordinary. I have to pay there, of course, but it’s something you don’t find in Paris, that they actually give you something to eat for your money. But that’s easier to do in the country than in Paris. Unfortunately for him, he got caught up in the gear-wheels himself. Working among people, in order to sell, it’s a job that requires observation, a cool head.  But if one is forced to give too much attention to the books, one loses self-confidence. About health, now; mine is basically even good enough for the north, these days. Assumption, therefore, that he can’t find the money; let’s not hesitate. In fact, we’re only tying ourselves up in this business for a year, let’s say. This restaurant where I am is very odd, it’s grey all over, the floor is of grey bitumen, like a pavement, grey paper on the wall. Green blinds, always closed. A big green curtain in front of the ever-open door stops the dust coming in.  So not everything is brilliantly coloured all the time. For example, I saw a cowshed with 4 cows the colour of café au lait, and a calf the same colour, the cowshed a blue white, covered in cobwebs, the cows very clean and very beautiful, a big green curtain, against dust and flies, in the outside door. Grey too, Velázquez grey.  There was a tranquillity about it — this café au lait and tobacco brown of the cows’ hides, with the soft white bluish grey of the walls, the green curtain and the yellow and sparkling green of the sunny exterior making a brilliant contrast. You see how there are other things still to do, quite different from what I’ve done.  Not completely impossible that I might have her pose in the open air, and her mother as well — a gardener — colour of earth, who was thus dirty yellow and faded blue. The young girl’s café au lait complexion was darker than the pink of her bodice. The mother was marvellous, her dirty yellow and faded blue figure stood out in the full sun against a brilliant square of snow-white and lemon-yellow flowers. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b562 a-b V/19My dear Theo, At the moment we have a very glorious, powerful heat here, with no wind, which suits me very well. Sunshine, a light which, for want of a better word I can only call yellow — pale sulphur yellow, pale lemon, gold. How beautiful yellow is! And how much better shall I see the north. Ah, I’m always wishing that the day will come when you’ll see and feel the sun of the south. Ever yours, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b563 a V/19My dear Theo, At the moment I’m working on a study like this:  It’s a rather sad prospect to have to say to myself that the painting I do will perhaps never have any value. If it was worth what it costs I could say to myself, I’ve never concerned myself about money. It’s so true what he says: You believe, unfortunate souls, that when the artist has mastered his talent and gained his reputation, that then he’s home and dry?  Now I have a horror of success; I’m afraid of the morning after following a success by the Impressionists; even the present difficult days will later seem like ‘the good times’ to us. And we must settle down in the least expensive place. Then we’ll have the peace of mind needed to produce a large amount, even if we sell little or nothing. But if expenses exceeded income, we’d be wrong to hope too much that everything would work out through the sale of our paintings. On the contrary, we’d be obliged to part with them at any price at the wrong time.  If I had the same ambitions as he has, we probably wouldn’t get on well together. But I don’t care about my success nor about my happiness, I care about the continuation of the energetic undertakings of the Impressionists, I care about this question of a refuge and of daily bread for them. And I feel it a crime that I have that, while two can live on the same amount. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b565 a-b V/1962vincent Original telegram Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b566 V/1962 Date of postmark: Wednesday, 15 August 1888. Telegram. Postmark: ‘CENTRAL PARIS / 15 AOUT 85My dear Theo Of course, you could also meet him at the Gare de Lyon itself, but first of all it’s further away, then you’d have to get up quite early. He has been very kind to me, particularly these past few days. He’ll come back to Paris for a week, but is spending the major part of his holidays in the north. I mean, she’ll see painting in its rough state. But do me the great pleasure of showing her one or two studies put back on stretching frames and framed in white. You can take the previous ones off their stretching frames and frames. You’re enough of a judge of painting to see and to appreciate what originality I may have, and you’re also enough of a judge to see the pointlessness of presenting to today’s public what I’m doing, because the others surpass me in more precise brushwork. It has more to do with the wind and circumstances than with what I could do without the mistral, and without these inevitable circumstances of vanished youth and relative poverty. For my part, I’m in no way set on changing my situation, and I actually count myself only too happy to be able to continue as it is. I shake your hand firmly, and I do hope to have news from you on Friday or Saturday. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b567 V/19My dear Theo, Because instead of trying to render exactly what I have before my eyes, I use colour more arbitrarily in order to express myself forcefully. Well, let’s let that lie as far as theory goes, but I’m going to give you an example of what I mean. This man will be blond. I’d like to put in the painting my appreciation, my love that I have for him. I’ll paint him, then, just as he is, as faithfully as I can — to begin with. But the painting isn’t finished like that. To finish it, I’m now going to be an arbitrary colourist.  I exaggerate the blond of the hair, I come to orange tones, chromes, pale lemon. Behind the head — instead of painting the dull wall of the mean room, I paint the infinite. I make a simple background of the richest, most intense blue that I can prepare, and with this simple combination, the brightly lit blond head, against this rich blue background achieves a mysterious effect, like a star in the deep azure. Similarly, I’ve proceeded in this way in the peasant’s portrait. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to get that in a pose, and yet you need an intelligent model to be able to do the painting. I must tell you now that materially speaking, these days are extremely hard. Whatever I do, living is pretty expensive here, more or less like Paris, where, while spending 5 or 6 francs a day, you don’t have much. So I assure you that if by chance you sometimes sent me a little more money, that would benefit the paintings, but not me. Myself, I only have the choice between being a good painter or a bad one. I choose the former. But the things needed for painting are like those of a ruinous mistress; you can do nothing without money, and you never have enough of it. And so painting should be done at society’s expense, and the artist shouldn’t be overburdened by it. Fortunately my stomach has recovered to such an extent that I lived for 3 weeks of the month on ship’s biscuits with milk, eggs. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b561 V/1962 1st column: \t2 64 x 54 2 frames 1 55 x 38 ,, 2nd column:\t2 / 19 x 24 frame 72 92 60 x My dear Theo The day when you could, would you — not give me, but lend me 300 francs for a year, all at one go? That would give me a saving of 300 francs a year, because it’s still 1 franc a night that I’m paying to the lodging-house keeper. I’d have the sense of a more permanent home, and really it’s a condition for being able to work. Which is sheer madness. To be carefree, to hope that one of these days I’ll be freed from pennilessness: pure illusion. I’ll count myself well content to work for an allowance that’s just enough and my peace and quiet in my studio for the rest of my life. I mean to be inflexible on this point of setting up a permanent studio and to sleep there and not at the guest-house. I only say this, that if we don’t take advantage of this opportunity to free ourselves from lodging-house keepers, we’re throwing into the water all your money and our possibility of withstanding the siege of pennilessness. On that my mind is well and truly made up, and I don’t wish to give in on that point. Ever yours, Vincent I prefer to cloister myself like the monks, free to go to the brothel, just like the monks, or to the wine shop if our heart tells us to. But our work requires a home. Not that it bothers me, because I know what I want and what I don’t want. And I’m therefore quite resolved not to go to Pont-Aven, unless there too we were to find a house at the low end of prices (15 francs a month is the price of mine), and unless we were to set ourselves up in it so as to be able to sleep there. I’ll write to our sister this evening if I find the time. I kiss her affectionately in thought. Handshake. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b564 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b563 b V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, I’ve again missed some models that I hoped to have these past few days. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b568 V/1962My dear Theo, I add here an order that’s urgent. I’m now on the fourth painting of sunflowers. As long as we were preparing the way for richer lives for the painters who will walk in our footsteps, that would already be something. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b569 V/19My dear Theo, Now there’s something that was really healthy. As far as my clothes are concerned, they were certainly starting to suffer — but only last week I bought a black velvet jacket of quite good quality for 20 francs, and a new hat, so that’s not at all urgent. However, that hardly upsets the calculation that by saving the money for lodgings, at the end of a year you find you own furniture without having spent any more during the year. And as soon as I’m able, I won’t hesitate to do that. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b570 V/1962My dear Theo, On 1 September I’ll have my rent to pay, and if you could send me the money for the week the same day as you receive yours for the month, first of all I would pay the rent the same day, then the outlay would cover both weeks for me. Lastly, if there was some way that you could send me the money on Sunday in your letter or by money order, it wouldn’t leave me indifferent to gain a day that way. I have a mass of ideas for my work, and by continuing the figure very assiduously, I’d possibly find something new. But what can you do, sometimes I feel too weak in the face of the given circumstances, and I’d have to be wiser and richer and younger to win the fight. Fortunately for me, I no longer count at all on any victory, and in painting I look for nothing more than the means of getting by in life. We’ve had two or three glorious days here, very hot, with no wind. The grapes are beginning to ripen, but you hear people saying they won’t be good. I must do some more work today. Because of the models, I’m dreading these last days of the week a little. I’m still negotiating with some other people about posing; there’s something that’s urging me always to do as many figure studies as possible. Circumstances could get even worse in future, and well, whatever the case may be, once I’ve mastered the figure, work will seem more serious to me. Ever yours, Vincent Vexations with models continue all the same, and what with the tenacity of the mistral down here, that doesn’t cheer me up. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b571 V/1962My dear Theo, I feel that even at the present time I could be an entirely different painter if I was able to settle the question of models. But I also feel the possibility of getting dull-witted and of seeing the time of potency in artistic production disappearing, just as in the course of life our balls start to let us down. That’s inevitable, and of course, here as there it’s self-confidence and striking while the iron’s hot that’s pressing. But in that case it would only be fair that he should also reimburse you in paintings for what you would do for him. For me, it’s a constant sorrow to do so comparatively little with the money I spend. My life is restless and anxious, but then, moving house and moving around a lot, perhaps I would only make things worse. It makes enormous trouble for me that I don’t speak the Provençal patois.  At present I often stop myself when planning a painting, because of the paint it costs us. Now, that’s rather a pity, all the same, for this good reason, that perhaps we have the power to work today, but we don’t know if it’ll still be there tomorrow. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b572 V/19My dear Theo, Well, we’ll have to go on urging her to untangle her personality, rather than her artistic abilities. Now for them, it’s to be taken into account that they were very badly housed, not in terms of their beds, but of the possibility of working at home. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b573 a-b V/19My dear Theo That’ll put them to some very small expenses at home (they put up enough useless people), but after all, it would be an opportunity to become acquainted. But let’s not press the point. Now let’s be careful about it. If it doesn’t suit him, he could reproach me: ‘why have you made me come to this filthy part of the country?’  And I don’t want any of that. I say to myself, let’s behave as if he wasn’t there, then if he comes, so much the better, if he doesn’t come, too bad. But if we have to make a fortune first......... we’ll be totally neurotic by the time we reach that sort of tranquillity, and that’s worse than our present state, in which we can still stand all sorts of noises. But let’s be wise enough to know that we’re getting dull-witted all the same. It’s better to lodge others than not to be lodged ourselves here, especially lodging with an innkeeper, which even when you pay doesn’t provide you with a lodging where you feel at home. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b574 a-b V/1962 and b584 b V/19My dear Theo, Later on, when I’ve taken those experiments further, the sower will still be the first attempt in that genre. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b575 V/19My dear Theo, Naturally, that ate up most of my money. Let’s say that in a year you come to spend a holiday here and in Marseille, it will be ready then — and the way I envisage it, the house will be just full of paintings from top to bottom.  So for the beds I bought local beds, two wide double beds, instead of iron beds. It gives a look of solidity, durability, calm, and if it takes a bit more bed-linen, that’s too bad, but it must have character. I wouldn’t be able to explain to you how pleased I am to find a big, serious job this way. Because I hope it’ll be a true decoration that I’m going to undertake there. So, as I’ve already told you, I’m going to paint my own bed, there’ll be 3 subjects. Perhaps a naked woman, I haven’t decided, perhaps a cradle with a child; I don’t know, but I’ll take my time. I now no longer feel any hesitation about staying here, because ideas for work are coming to me in abundance. I now plan to buy some article for the house every month. And with patience, the house will be worth something for the furniture and the decorations. In my painting of the night café I’ve tried to express the idea that the café is a place where you can ruin yourself, go mad, commit crimes. Anyway, I tried with contrasts of delicate pink and blood-red and wine-red. Soft Louis XV and Veronese green contrasting with yellow greens and hard blue greens.  All of that in an ambience of a hellish furnace, in pale sulphur.  Only we’d then have to tell them that I’d like to reserve a second exhibition for myself, after this first one of what are in fact studies. His other fine colours are really inferior, especially for the blues. I’m doing comparatively less, and coming back to it longer. I’ve kept back 50 francs for the week; thus there has already been 250 for the furniture. And I’ll recoup them anyway, doing it this way. And from today you can say to yourself that you have a sort of country house, unfortunately a bit far away. But it would cease to be very, very far if we had a permanent exhibition in Marseille. We’ll see that in a year, perhaps. Handshake and Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. now. b576 a-b V/1962 Van Gogh enclosed a paint order which has not survived.My dear Theo, I won’t dwell on what he has to do. You offer him hospitality here, and you accept the only means of payment he has, his paintings. But if in addition to and apart from that, he demanded that you pay for his journey, he’s going a bit far, and at least he should very openly offer you some of his paintings, and appeal to you as well as to me in terms less vague than ‘my debt increasing from day to day, my journey is becoming more and more unlikely’. But he has a stomach-ache, and when you have a stomach-ache, you don’t have free will. Now I don’t have a stomach-ache, at present. And as a result I feel my head freer, and I should hope more lucid. Because, if the association is created under these conditions, you will feel, I don’t say happier, but more of an artist and more productive than with me alone. For him, as for me, we’ll feel very clearly that we must succeed, because the honour of all three of us is involved there, and because we’re not working just for ourselves. That seems to me to be the case. It’s better to have serenity than to be too fearful. But neither he nor we should be crushed. Anyway, there’s a beautiful calm in his letter all the same. Although he leaves his intentions towards us unexplained. But if we wish to do this thing well, it will require loyalty on his part. I’m quite curious to know what he’ll write to you himself; I’ll reply to him exactly as I feel, but I don’t want to say melancholy or sad or mean things to so great an artist. Now that’s why, in the case of some sort of association, we have to have the conditions settled well and clearly, precisely so that we don’t fall out later. More soon, and good handshake. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b579 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Considering that I can’t bring the north closer to the south, what’s to be done? And that then it was two permanent studios instead of one. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b577 a-b V/1962 The letter is not signed, so it may be incompletMy dear Theo, It’s probable that I’ll have news from you tomorrow morning, but this evening I have time to write to you, and the week has been rather eventful. I plan to go to live in the house tomorrow, but having already bought things, and having more to add — and I’m talking only of what’s strictly necessary — you’ll have to send me 100 francs again, instead of 50. If I count 50 francs for myself for last week, and if I therefore deduct them from the 300 francs sent, I only have left, even with another 50 francs extra, the bare price of the two beds. And so you see that, even if I’ve already bought many other things in addition to the beds themselves, with bed linen, that I’ve spent most of the 50 francs for the week on it, and in part I’ve saved on one bed or the other by making one of them a little plainer. I’m convinced that in the end we’re doing well by furnishing the studio. Only if I take greater care, I hope, over the style and quality of my work, it will go a little more slowly, or rather, I’ll be obliged to keep the paintings with me longer. So that there’ll be things that hold together and complement each other. And also because there’ll be paintings that I really don’t want to send you before they’re as dry as a bone. But as it’s larger, there’s a lemon-coloured sky above it all, and then the colours have the richness and intensities of autumn. Then it’s done in much heavier impasto, plain and thick. I purposely bought a good enough mirror to work from myself, for want of a model, because if I can manage to paint the coloration of my own head, which is not without presenting some difficulty, I’ll surely be able to paint the heads of the other fellows and women as well. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b580 V/19My dear Theo, Ah well, I feel more or less sure of succeeding in making a decoration that will be worth 10 thousand francs in time. Let me say — If here we set up a studio-refuge for one or other of our pals who are broke, no one will ever be able to reproach us, neither you nor me, with living and spending for ourselves alone.  Now to set up such a studio you need a working capital; now it’s I who have eaten it up in the course of my unproductive years, and I’ll pay it back now that I’m beginning to produce. I assure you that, for you as well as for me, I judge it to be indispensable, but what’s more our right, always to have a louis or a few louis in our pocket, and a certain stock of merchandise to handle. But my idea would be that in the end we’d have set up and would leave to posterity a studio in which a successor could live. I don’t know if I’m expressing myself clearly enough, but in other words: we’re working at an art, at matters that won’t be of our times only but which may also be continued by others after us. You’re kind to painters, and be sure that the more I think about it the more I feel that there’s nothing more genuinely artistic than to love people. You’ll say to me that then we’d do well to do without art and artists. That’s true on the face of it, but after all, the Greeks and the French and the old Dutchmen accepted art, and we see art always recover after inevitable periods of decline — and I don’t believe that we’d be more virtuous for this reason, that we had a horror of artists and their art. At present I don’t yet find my paintings good enough for the benefits I’ve had from you. But once they’re good enough, I assure you that you will have created them just as much as I, and the fact is that we make them together. But I won’t labour the point, because it will become as clear as daylight to you if I succeed in doing things a little more seriously.  I believe that it’ll be necessary to be very firm and very categorical in all of this. And without giving our reasons, to speak very clearly. In principle, in theory, I’m for an association of artists protecting their livelihood and their work, but in principle and in theory I’m equally against attempts to destroy old firms, once established. Just let them rot in peace and die a natural death. It’s pure presumption to try to revive the trade. Have nothing to do with it, protect your livelihoods among yourselves, live as a family, as brothers and companions; splendid; even in a case where that didn’t succeed, I’d like to be part of it, but I’ll never be part of a manoeuvre against other dealers. I shake your hand firmly; I hope that what I’m forced to ask of you won’t cause you too much financial trouble. But I didn’t want to delay going to sleep at my house. And if you’re in financial difficulties yourself, I’ll get through the week with 20 francs more, but that will be urgent. Ever yours, Vincent I myself don’t blame an artist of his merit for saying, you’ll pay my journey and my debt if you wish me to come, because I don’t have any — any money. But on the other hand, in that case he’d have to be very generous with his paintings. Then — but we’d still have to have the money — I wouldn’t see any harm in the thing. But these paintings, which will be sold one day, will tie up the interest on what they cost, perhaps for many years to come. And in fact, a painting for which we pay 400 francs today and which we sell for 1,000 francs ten years later is still sold at cost price, because it has sat there doing nothing. But you know this better than I do. I shouldn’t be surprised if little by little you regain a love of business, or at least that you’ll be reconciled with your present position when you’ll feel that those who invent new things in business don’t know how to make a great revolution in it. You’re kind to artists, you are, in fact, right at the heart of the trade, you do what you can, you’re damned right. Only take care of your health if you can, and don’t get upset about nothing. That will come quite of its own accord now, if it must come. If there was a benefit in living together, there’s nothing to prevent you agreeing to buy something from him from time to time, if it’s possible. But no sort of contract with him, he’s too changeable. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b581 a-b V/1962 (sheets 1 and 2) and b582 V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, But my colours, my canvas, my wallet are completely exhausted today. The last painting, done with the last tubes on the last canvas, is a naturally green garden, is painted without green as such, with nothing but Prussian blue and chrome yellow. I’m beginning to feel quite different from what I was when I came here, I have no more doubts, I no longer hesitate to tackle something, and that could increase still further. As long as you can bear the burden of all the colours, canvas, money that I’m forced to spend, keep on sending me them. Because what I’m preparing will be better than the last consignment, and believe that we’ll gain rather than lose by it. If, that is, I manage to do an ensemble that will hold together. Which I’m trying to do. I don’t doubt in the very least that one day you too will know the south. This afternoon I had a select audience..... of 4 or 5 pimps and a dozen kids who found it particularly interesting to watch the colours come out of the tubes. Ah, well, that sort of audience — that’s fame, or rather, I have the firm intention of thumbing my nose at ambition and fame, like these kids and these ruffians from the banks of the Rhône and rue du Bout d’Arles.  And I’m so afraid of taking it away from you with my requests for money. I think you did quite well, all the same, to buy so many stretching frames, because you have to have a certain number to be able to dry the canvases thoroughly, which preserves them, and I also have a whole lot of them here myself. But you mustn’t hesitate to take them off the stretching frames, so that everything doesn’t take up too much space. Even if for your part you use up your purse and what’s in it, true, it’s bad, but say to me calmly: there’s nothing left, then there’ll be more, because of what I’ll have done with it. But — you’ll say to me, rightly — in the meantime? In the meantime — I’ll draw, because it’s more convenient to do nothing but draw than to paint. I shake your hand firmly. What days these are, not because of events, but I feel so strongly that we’re not decadents, you and I, and not finished yet, and won’t be, in time to come. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b583 a-b V/19My dear Theo At present I’ve also bought a dressing-table with all the necessaries, and my own little bedroom is furnished. None of that’s at all urgent, and as a result I can already see the goal, to have the means of having a roof over my head for a good long time. I’m also thinking of planting two oleanders outside the door, in tubs. But I can’t, or rather, I don’t wish, to paint it without models. But I have it in my mind with colour — the starry night, the figure of Christ blue, the strongest blues, and the angel broken lemon yellow. And all the purples from a blood-red purple to ash in the landscape. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b584 a V/19My dear Theo, The fine weather of these past few days has disappeared and has been replaced by mud and rain. But it will surely return before the winter. Only it’ll be a matter of taking advantage of it because — the fine days — are short — Ah well — if inevitably we’re too often faced with a shortage of models, and especially of intelligent models, we mustn’t despair or grow weary of the struggle for that reason. Anyway, not having read the book itself, I couldn’t say exactly how he conceives of the matter, but I believe that his religion cannot be cruel and increase our sufferings, but on the contrary, it must be very consoling and must inspire serenity, and energy, and the courage to live, and a whole lot of things. It’s more than likely that that person would be a bit shocked and would pity my ignorance and my bad taste. I believe that eventually I’ll stop feeling lonely in the house, and that on days of bad winter weather, for example, and in the long evenings, I’ll find an occupation that will absorb me completely. A weaver, a basket-maker, often spends entire seasons alone, or almost alone, with his work as his only pastime. And for me, I believe that it’s my absolute duty to try to earn money with my work, and so I see my work quite clearly ahead of me. Ah, if only all artists had enough to live on — enough to work on — but that not being so, I wish to produce, and to produce a great deal, and with intense effort and determination. And perhaps the day will come when we can expand our business and be more influential for others. But that’s a long way off, and there’s a great deal of work to be got through first. If we were living in wartime we’d possibly have to fight, we’d regret it, we’d bemoan not living in peacetime, but at all events, the necessity being there — we’d fight. In short, there are many more people who can skilfully make a croquis than people who can paint freely and who grasp nature from the point of view of colour. That will always be rarer, and whether or not the paintings are slow to be appreciated, they’ll find their collector one day. I believe that the town of Arles was once infinitely more glorious for the beauty of its women, for the beauty of its traditional dress. Now it all looks sickly and faded as far as character goes. But if you look at it for a long time, the old charm reveals itself. And that’s why I understand that I’m losing absolutely nothing by staying where I am, and contenting myself with watching things go by, the way a spider in its web waits for flies. I can’t force anything, and as I’m settled now I can take advantage of all the fine days, all the opportunities to catch a real painting from time to time. But this blade of grass leads him to draw all the plants — then the seasons, the broad features of landscapes, finally animals, and then the human figure. He spends his life like that, and life is too short to do everything. Just think of that; isn’t it almost a new religion that these Japanese teach us, who are so simple and live in nature as if they themselves were flowers? Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b586 a-b V/1962  My dear Theo, On top of that, he hardly has any time, since he’ll have to say his tender farewells to all the tarts and other pond-life in the Arles stewpond, now that his prick has gone back to the garrison, as he puts it. I think I should warn you right away that I’ll need another 5 or even 10 metres of canvas. And that at the same time I’ll also need That’s approximately in proportion to the canvas. Now, it fades to a certain extent, but by using zinc white and using it unmixed, I can do without the rest, if it comes to it. I wanted to do more sunflowers too, but they were already over. Yes, during the autumn I’d very much like to do a dozen or so square no. 30 canvases, and that may very well be achieved, as far as I can see. But I can put off taking delivery of the frames and stretching frames, and so I’ll get by, I hope, in any case. The only hope I have is that by working really hard, by the end of a year I’ll have enough paintings to be able to show myself — if I wish, or if you so desire — at that time of the exhibition. I’m not keen on it, but what I’m certainly keen on is to show you something that isn’t entirely bad. Whether we exhibit, whether we don’t exhibit, we must be productive, and after that we have the right to smoke our pipe in peace. But this year we’ll be productive, and I’m doing all I can to make sure that the new series is better than the first two consignments. For the starry sky, I still very much hope to paint it, and perhaps one of these evenings I’ll be in the same ploughed field, if the sky is twinkling brightly. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Private collection (sheet 1); Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b587 b V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, The bush is a variegated green, slightly tinged with bronze, the grass is very, very green, Veronese tinged with lemon, the sky is very, very blue. The line of bushes in the background are all raving mad oleanders. These bloody plants flower in such a way that they could surely catch locomotor ataxia! They’re covered in fresh blooms, and then in masses of faded blooms; their foliage also keeps on putting out strong new shoots, apparently inexhaustibly. A funereal cypress, completely black, stands above them and a number of small coloured figures are strolling along a pink path. Now that’s the garden that’s right in front of my house, after all. Because perhaps you’ll see from the sketch alone that the line is now simple. Again, this painting is heavily impasted, like its pendant with yellow sky. At the moment I have a clear head, or a lover’s blindness toward my work. Because being surrounded by colour like this is quite new to me, and excites me extraordinarily. Fatigue doesn’t come into it; I could do another painting tonight, even, and I could bring it home. If I tell you that it’s very urgent that I receive Also 5 metres of canvas. Ah, how I’d like you to see everything that I see these days! With so many beautiful things before me, I can’t help letting myself go. Especially because I feel that it’ll turn out a little better than the last consignment. But the last consignment was of studies that made me ready to be able to work with confidence these days that are windless. And it’s probable that I won’t do it, either, before some serious studies from life. But that’s not urgent; now I’m determined to work hard until I’ve surmounted it. If I want this letter to go off, I must hurry. He’s certainly free to do so. If it came to it, well, they could both come here and we’d find a way of putting them up. Ever yours, Vincent.

It was sold at Sotheby’s New York on 13 November 1997 (present whereabouts unknownMy dear Theo, Included herewith little croquis of a square no. 30 canvas — the starry sky at last, actually painted at night, under a gas-lamp. The sky is green-blue, the water is royal blue, the areas of land are mauve. The town is blue and violet. The gaslight is yellow, and its reflections are red gold and go right down to green bronze. Against the green-blue field of the sky the Great Bear has a green and pink sparkle whose discreet paleness contrasts with the harsh gold of the gaslight. Likewise croquis of a square no. 30 canvas showing the house and its surroundings under a sulphur sun, under a pure cobalt sky. That’s a really difficult subject! But I want to conquer it for that very reason. Because it’s tremendous, these yellow houses in the sunlight and then the incomparable freshness of the blue. Certainly, his arrival would increase the importance of this venture of painting in the south by 100 per cent. And once here, I don’t see him leaving soon, because I believe he would put down roots. With this quiet weather, I let myself go and I have less need to struggle against impossibilities. And there’s absolutely nothing dishonest about dealing in good stones. One can believe in oneself when the thing one’s selling is good. Now if, though, people like paste, they’re at liberty to do so, and since they ask for it, well, one may keep it in stock. Good handshake and more soon, and thank you very much, and I hope your pains won’t last. Have you seen a doctor again? Look after yourself, because physical pain is so annoying.

This canal is 6.6 km long and links the bassin de la Villette with the Seine, close to the scene of the action described by Flaubert. See Baedeker 1889-1, pp. 62, 190. Cf. Noll 1994, pp. 171-17My dear Theo, But by joining together in this way, we’ll each of us be more ourselves, and unity will bring strength.  That way, you’ll be one of the first apostle-dealers, or the first. For myself, I can see my painting ahead, and also a labour among artists. Because if you, now, will try to obtain money for us — I myself will put everything that comes within my grasp towards production, and I’ll set an example of that myself. Now all that, if we hold firm, will go to build something more durable than ourselves. But it can already work now, just as it is. The fare’s the essential thing, and my colours can wait, although I dare believe that one day I’ll earn more with them than they’re costing us. If we continue to approach things from the right point of view, that’s to say of people and not of material things, it still seems not entirely improbable to me that our material problems may smooth themselves out. I’m continuing to frame studies, because they’re part of the furnishings and give things character. Good handshake, and more soon.

Le laid c’est l’infernal qui sait remuer l’âme, Et nous avons vraiment fini d’aimer la femme A l’oeil languide ainsi qu’un nu de Fragonard. –. Qu’on préfère la chair à l’étal, au grand art (Qui consiste l’on sait en de grandes machines Où se meuvent des reines, vierges, assasines Jeanne Darc ou Cathérine de Medicis,) Je n’en discute pas les charmes indécis, C’est le droit de chacun –. Mais plus au gouffre on plonge Plus dans notre cerveau le conceps s’allonge; Car sous les profondeurs eternelles des mers Dans les abîmes les plus noirs, les plus amers, La perle dort parmi les monstres et les herbes; La violette sous le tas pourri des gerbes Répand un doux parfum qui grise fortement.– Donc c’est que le hideux c’est l’unique élément – Le creuset d’où s’échappe un monde d’un abîme Dont la forme est le laid et le fond le Sublime. – . –  C’est pourquoi dans l’affreux j’aime a me recréer Et quand mon esprit las se refuse a créer Je vais aux lieux bannis où s’étale l’ivresse Pour mon cerveau chercher la divine caresse Que donne l’incompris à notre coeur béant –. Révélation morne et grande du NéantMy dear Theo, And like you, I’m hoping that he’ll come now. So, poetic landscapes. Do you know what I have left now, today, of your remittance that came today? Well, I have 6 francs left. It’s mostly the fault of the frames that I once ordered, and to which I’m very attached. I can’t finish off except in a frame. And besides, perhaps we’ll work with them in Marseille. I have three woods, walnut — chestnut — deal, for the frames. It’s very urgent because I already bought some canvas here just today, in order to be ready for tomorrow or the day after, depending on what the weather’s like. Here the fact is that you have to take advantage of the intervals the mistral leaves, and be ready beforehand. My dear Theo, a thousand thanks for both the consignment of colours and for today’s letter. Work absorbs me, and I feel certain of not losing by it if I can continue like this. These large canvases are all good. But they’re exhausting, too. Ever yours, Vincent. He needs to eat, to walk with me in some beautiful countryside — to have a screw once in a while — see the house as it is and as we’ll make it, and in a word, thoroughly enjoy himself. He’s been living cheaply, yes, but it’s been making him ill to the point where he can no longer distinguish a cheerful tone from a sad tone. Ah well, that’s no use at all. It’s high time he came, and then you’ll see, he’ll get better in no time. Or otherwise.......... But no otherwise; let’s assume — he’ll cheer up. But it’s certainly high time. I’m writing to you in haste; I’m working on a portrait. I shake your hand firmly. Ever yours, Vincent Don’t delay — if it doesn’t leave you too hard up — don’t delay in sending me the louis and the canvas. My dear Theo, And Monday’s the very day when I receive your letter. I ate at midday, but by this evening I’ll have to sup on a crust of bread. And it all goes into nothing else but either the house or the paintings. Because for at least 3 weeks I haven’t had enough to go and have a screw for 3 francs. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b591 V/1962 and b590 a-b V/1962 (sheet 2 and sheet 3, enclosurMy dear Theo, Ah well, my dear Theo, for your next letter, let me have it on Sunday. Handshake, and many thanks for the canvas; now we’ll be able to join battle once more. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b592 V/19My dear Theo, When he comes he’ll be welcome. If he doesn’t come, well, then, it’s his business. But isn’t it clear, or shouldn’t it be, that he’s coming here precisely in order to get better? And he claims to need to stay over there in order to recover! What stupidities! Honestly. Ever yours, Vincent Thank you for your letter — truly too full of compliments for me. So you’re not coming until the end of the month. Perfect — seeing that it must appear to you that you’ll recover more quickly in Brittany than here. I won’t press the point. Only, if your recovery wasn’t going well in Brittany, then think about this, that we think we could get you well here more quickly than that. But you write business, you talk about lithography. Here’s my opinion. Ever yours, Vincent So come as soon as you can, then! P.S. Did you receive my canvases??? If you aren’t too ill, please come right away. If you are too ill, telegram and letter, please. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b593 V/19My dear Theo, And that’s not all; I’d also like you to feel that we earn from the money that we transfer, and that by so doing, we’ll achieve a more complete independence than that provided by the trade as such. However, paintings come off better if one takes care of oneself and keeps well. But for you, for your work, for your whole life as well, you mustn’t have too many worries. How are those sciatic pains? Have they stopped? Whatever happens, you’d help me more by keeping well, by living well; even if the consignments of colours had to suffer as a result, than by being too much in straits on my account. I believe that the day will come when people will want the work — well — but perhaps that’s still far away, and meanwhile, don’t be too hard up. Be sure of this. If you were ill or if you had too much pain and trouble, nothing would work any more. And if you are well, business will eventually come to you by itself, and ideas for doing some business will come to you infinitely more by eating well than by not eating enough. Ever yours, Vincent And the thing won’t end with us either; we’re starting it off on quite a solid footing. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b594 a-b V/1962 (sheets 1, 2) and b586 c V/1962 (sheet 3). Van Gogh refers to the fact that the brothers are always short of money and can only support themselves through hard work. Nello is injured attempting a dangerous stunt and becomes a permanent invalid. Because the brothers are dependent on one another in their work, they are forced to abandon their careers as acrobatMy dear Theo, I had hardly dared hope so soon for your new 50-franc money order, for which I thank you very much. I have many expenses, and it sometimes distresses me greatly when I increasingly come to realize that painting is a craft that is probably practised by extremely poor people, since it costs a lot of money. This hasty croquis gives you its composition. Simple foreground of grey sand. Background very simple too, pink and yellow walls with windows with green louvred shutters, corner of blue sky. Now imagine a huge green-blue fir tree spreading its horizontal branches over a very green lawn and sand dappled with light and shade. Lastly, the Trinquetaille bridge with all its steps is a canvas done on a grey morning, the stones, the asphalt, the cobblestones are grey, the sky a pale blue, the small figures colourful, a puny tree with yellow foliage. Two canvases, then, in grey, broken tones, and two highly coloured canvases. Forgive these very poor croquis. I’m knocked out from painting this Tarascon diligence, and I can see that I haven’t a head fit for drawing. I’m off to have supper, and I’ll write to you again this evening. But this decoration is coming along a bit, and I believe that it will broaden my way of seeing and doing things. It will be open to a thousand criticisms; very well, but never mind, as long as I manage to put some spirit into it. But yes, good old Tartarin’s country, I’m enjoying myself there more and more, and it will become like a new homeland for us. I don’t forget Holland, though; it’s precisely the contrasts that make me think of it a lot. I’ll get back to this letter shortly.  Now I’m getting back to this letter again. How I’d like to be able to show you the work that’s in progress! I’m really so tired that I can see that my writing isn’t up to much. I’ll write to you better another time, because it’s beginning to take shape now, this idea of the decoration. And he’ll do such fine things here. He’ll need time to recover. I assure you that I believe that if ideas for work are coming to me more clearly and more abundantly at present, then eating good food has a lot to do with it. And that’s what everybody in painting should have. I’m really falling asleep standing up, and I can’t see any longer, my eyes are so tired. More soon, because I still had lots of things to say, and I should make you some better croquis. Probable that I’ll do it tomorrow. Thank you many times again for your money order. I shake your hand firmly. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b596 a-c V/1962 The sheets a-b were part of a single folded sheeMy dear Theo, Would be very pleased if you could find the time to write and give me some details of what they are. I was, and still am, almost knocked out by last week’s work. And tomorrow I’ll have got over this exhaustion. Ah, if the weather’s fine here you have to take advantage of it, otherwise you’d never do anything. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b597 V/19My dear Theo — At last I’m sending you a little croquis to give you at least an idea of the direction the work is taking. Because today I’ve gone back to it. My eyes are still tired, but anyway I had a new idea in mind, and here’s the croquis of it. No. 30 canvas once again. The walls are of a pale violet. The floor — is of red tiles. The bedstead and the chairs are fresh butter yellow. The sheet and the pillows very bright lemon green. The blanket scarlet red. The window green. The dressing table orange, the basin blue. The doors lilac. And that’s all — nothing in this bedroom, with its shutters closed. The solidity of the furniture should also now express unshakeable repose. Portraits on the wall, and a mirror and a hand-towel and some clothes. The frame — as there’s no white in the painting — will be white. This to take my revenge for the enforced rest that I was obliged to take. I’ll work on it again all day tomorrow, but you can see how simple the idea is. The shadows and cast shadows are removed; it’s coloured in flat, plain tints like Japanese prints. I won’t write to you at length, because I’m going to start very early tomorrow with the fresh morning light, to finish my canvas. How are your pains? Don’t forget to give me news about them. I hope you’ll write in the next few days. One day I’ll do you some croquis of the other rooms as well. I shake your hand firmly. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b599 V/1962 (sheet 1) and d311 V/1970 (sheet 2) The enclosed sketch is the same size as the letter and was drawn on the same squared paper. Both have one crease. There is no indication that the sheets were ever part of a single folded sheet (there are no visible traces of the ink from the drawing on the letterMy dear Theo, But all the same it astonishes me that you tell me about them and their frame (costing, if I remember rightly, 2,000 francs), but that you don’t say a single word about what there was in that frame, nor a single word about what they’ve done in paintings. It gave me great pleasure to have your news, but it astonishes me so much not to know what there was in that frame. As far as selling goes, of course I think you’re right not to look for it deliberately, of course I myself would prefer never to sell if the thing could be done. But if we were nevertheless forced to it, after what has happened we no longer have an alternative, of course, if it should indeed become necessary one day, we could do no better than not be hasty. I shake your hand firmly, and I hope you’ll tell me what there actually was in the frame. And to our new friends, warm regards and good luck, which I wish them. If they want to see something new, certainly, let them go to the south or Africa or to Sicily if it’s winter. But it’s only — if they have originality — the real south that will show them something different from Holland. I hope you’ll write to me again before long. Good handshake Ever yours, Vincent Certainly, from time to time I’d like to be able to do a little business for a change, and by doing so earn some money on my own account. But since we can change nothing about it for the moment, let’s accept this inevitable fact, that you’ll always be condemned to trade, without rest or variation, and I that mine is also without rest, constant work that’s really tiring and absorbing for the mind. I hope that in a year you’ll feel that the two of us have created an artistic thing. Anyway, let’s not think too deeply about good and bad, that always being very relative. Ever yours, Vincent True, if we’re not producing framed paintings like these Dutchmen, you and I, all the same we’re making paintings like Japanese prints, and let’s keep it to that, no more. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b600 a-b V/19My dear Theo, But even for all that, I don’t believe that my madness would be of the persecution kind, since my feelings in a state of excitement have more to do with preoccupations about eternity and eternal life. But even so, I must be wary of my nerves, &c. I have a great urge to write you a letter just so that you can have them read it, to explain once again why I myself believe in the south for the future and the present. Well then, since I have the firm intention not to paint for at least 3 days, perhaps I’ll rest by writing to you and to them at the same time. Because you know that that interests me a good deal, the influence that Impressionism will have on Dutch painters and on Dutch art lovers. Here’s very rough croquis of my last canvas. A row of green cypresses against a pink sky with a pale lemon crescent moon. It horrifies me to have to ask you for money again, but I can do nothing about it, and what’s more, I’m worn out again. However, I’d believe that the work that I’m doing while spending a little more will one day seem to us less costly than my previous work. As that couldn’t be done, I nevertheless pressed ahead as far as I could with what I had on the go, in a strong desire to be able to show him something new. And not to fall under his influence (because of course he’ll have an influence on me, I hope) before being able to show him beyond any doubt my own originality. He’ll see that anyway from the decoration as it is now. Ever yours, Vincent  Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b601 V/19My dear Theo I have another no. 30 canvas, autumn garden, two bottle-green and bottle-shaped cypresses, three little chestnut trees with tobacco-coloured and orange foliage. A small yew with pale lemon foliage, with purple trunk. Two small bushes with blood-red and scarlet purple foliage. But let me work as long as it isn’t absolutely impossible. Because if I don’t take advantage of the opportunities, it would be even worse. And listen to this. As soon as you can, and even right away if the thing were possible, I need another 10 metres of canvas at 2.50 francs. Then large tubes like the silver white and zinc white. Ah well, I must say nevertheless that it would absolutely astonish me if we weren’t able to overcome NO MATTER WHAT difficulties of production. It might be better if they didn’t get lively, but after all, we’ll just have to take things as they come. The leaves are starting to fall; the trees are visibly yellowing, the yellow increasing every day. It’s at least as beautiful as the orchards in blossom, and as for the work that we may do, I dare believe that indeed far from losing by it, we could gain by it. But anyway. In any case, would you please send me some more money (50 if possible, and otherwise less) by return of post and certainly no later. And if you didn’t have time to write, I’d ask you please to send it by money order, whether it’s more, or less, as you were able. I shake your hand firmly. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b595 V/19My dear Theo I can do nothing about it if my paintings don’t sell. The day will come, though, when people will see that they’re worth more than the cost of the paint and my subsistence, very meagre in fact, that we put into them. I have no other wish nor other concern regarding money or finances than in the first place not to have debts. But my dear brother, my debt is so great that when I’ve paid it, which I think I’ll succeed in doing, the hardship of producing paintings will, however, have taken my entire life, and it will seem to me that I haven’t lived. The only thing is that perhaps the production of paintings will become a little more difficult for me, and as far as the number goes, there won’t always be as many. But in money matters it’s enough for me to feel this truth, that a man who lives for 50 years and spends two thousand a year spends a hundred thousand francs, and that he must bring a hundred thousand in, too. To make a thousand paintings at a hundred francs during one’s life as an artist is very, very, very hard, but when the painting is at a hundred francs...... and again.... our task is very heavy at times. But nothing about that can be altered. And after a time you’ll have some work. I believe that the day will come when I’ll sell too, but I’m so far behind with you, and while I spend I bring nothing in. That feeling sometimes makes me sad. More soon, and I shake your hand firmly. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b602 V/19My dear Theo, I’m still very glad to know that you’re no longer alone in the apartment. My brain feels tired and dry again, but I’m better this week than the previous fortnight. I regret not being ten or twenty years younger; I’d certainly go. Now not very likely that I’ll move from the coast, and the little yellow house here in Arles will remain what it is, a halfway house between Africa and the tropics and the people of the north. In the evening especially, with the gaslight, I like the look of the studio very much. And I believe that in the evening we’ll bring neighbours and friends here, and that in the evening we’ll work as in the daytime, chatting as we do so. Portraits of people lit by gaslight — that always seems to me a thing to do. I shake your hand firmly, and write to us soon. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b605 V/19My dear Theo, Since I was in a state of terrible anxiety about making you make an effort beyond your strength. Have no fear that I may have money worries. He’ll even be able to put some money aside, the more he sells. Which, in a year, let’s say, he can use to settle in Martinique, and which he couldn’t put aside otherwise. You’ll have my work, and a painting by him in addition, every month. And I’ll do the same work without having so much trouble, and without running up so many expenses. But in the past it seemed to me that the partnership that we’ve just entered into was a good policy. The house is going very, very well and is becoming not only comfortable but also an artists’ house. So have no fears for me, nor for yourself, either. So have no worries about us on your part, and catch your breath, too, which you’ll darned well need. Later, then, if you keep my paintings for yourself, either in Paris or here, I’ll be much happier to be able to say bluntly that you prefer to keep my work for us than to sell it, than to have to get involved in the struggle for money at this moment. Most certainly. Ever yours, Vincent And the whole thing, I don’t know anything about it myself yet, because I need more canvases of the other seasons. But for my part, I find the landscape here very easily, and quite varied. So at last my little work potters along. I dare believe that you’ll like the new Sower. I’m writing in haste, we have heaps of work. He and I plan to go to the brothels a lot, but only to study them. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b603 a-b V/19My dear Theo, We’re working a great deal, and our life together is going very well. I’m very happy to know that you’re not alone in the apartment. In any case, to come here at some time or another would do them no harm, they’ll certainly find interesting things. So as not to delay this letter I’ll finish it for today. I hope to write to you again soon. I think that you’d like the leaf-fall that I’ve done. It’s lilac poplar trunks cut by the frame where the leaves begin. But if only you’d been with us on Sunday! We saw a red vineyard, completely red like red wine. In the distance it became yellow, and then a green sky with a sun, fields violet and sparkling yellow here and there after the rain in which the setting sun was reflected. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b606 V/19My dear Theo, We’ve hardly ever exhibited, have we? Now I declare here that I absolutely do not know what useful purpose that even serves, and it would seem to me more just, certainly, that you should simply keep the studies that you liked in your apartment, that you send the others back to me here rolled up, since the apartment is small and if you kept everything they’d clutter it up. So, without our hurrying I’m preparing the wherewithal here to stage a more serious exhibition. But as for the Revue Indépendante I’d ask you to put a complete end to it, the opportunity is too good, and you’ll feel that they’re completely mistaken if they imagine I’m going to pay to have myself put on show in such a small, dark and above all scheming hole. I’m going to set myself to work often from memory, and the canvases done from memory are always less awkward and have a more artistic look than the studies from nature, especially when I’m working in mistral conditions. The weather’s windy and rainy here, and I’m very happy not to be alone, I work from memory on bad days, and that wouldn’t work if I were alone. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b608 V/1962 Van Gogh enclosed a letter for Edouard Dujardin that has not survived. He also sent a copy of the letter to Schuffenecker, adding: ‘You see that I do not beat about the bush, and that I take the opportunity to obtain revenge for you – and to say what I think about all these coteries. I should like to see the look on these gentlemen’s faces when they read my letter’. (Vous voyez que je n’y vais pas par 4 chemins et que j’en profite pour vous venger – et pour dire ce que je pense de toutes ces coteries. Je voudrais voir la tête de ces messieurs quand ils liront ma lettre). See Merlhès 1989, p. 182My dear Theo, Thanks very much for sending me 100 francs and for your letter. A very nice letter, in which she talks of times gone by. I’ll reply to it and will send another few croquis in the letter. He’s a really great artist and a really excellent friend. I’ve been working on two canvases. We’d be infinitely obliged. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b609 V/19My dear Theo, But although I quite like this canvas, it’s all the better that it should be sold, since the two he’s going to send you from here are thirty times better. I don’t want to leave any doubt about what I think of that.  First, if you yourself would like to place either a bad or good thing of mine there, my word if that will make you happier, then of course you have and will have carte blanche either now or later. If you were to ask me what would give me pleasure, it’s quite simply one single thing, that you keep for yourself what you like from what I do, in the apartment, and that you don’t sell any of it now. So what does selling any of it matter if we’re not absolutely pressed for money? For in addition, I’m sure even now that you’ll eventually see things that way. But as for me, my word I have an old grudge against them. Be sure and certain that I consider you, as a seller of Impressionist paintings, to be very independent of the Goupils, that it will therefore always be a pleasure for me to urge artists to go there. But I don’t want Boussod ever to have a chance to say ‘this little canvas isn’t too bad for this young beginner’, as if never before... If one or the other wants to buy however, fine, all they have to do is approach me directly. But be sure of this: if we can withstand the siege my day will come. I cannot and must not at this moment do anything other than work. Handshake — we’ll need some more colours.   I must also tell you that the month with the two of us together is going better on 150 each than I did on 250 just for myself. At the end of a year you’ll notice that this is working after all. What’s more, when that’s done I must work on them again to retouch them. If I sent you any of them now, their colour would be duller than it will be later. But that will take more money by my calculations than by his. You won’t lose anything by waiting a little while for my work, and we’ll calmly leave our dear pals to scorn the present ones. Fortunately for me I know what I want better than they believe and am, basically, extremely indifferent to the criticism of working hurriedly. I’m not of that opinion — only don’t think that I’m weakening. I regret as always, as you know, the scarcity of models, the thousand obstacles to overcome that difficulty. So, perseverance. One more handshake, and thanks for everything you’re doing for me. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b610 a-b V/1962 The sale did not go through. Theo finally sold the canvas in September 1889. See exhib. cat. Amsterdam 1999, p. 13My dear Theo, Anyhow, a lot more water will flow under the bridge before then. Let’s calmly wait to exhibit until I have around thirty no. 30 canvases. Then we’ll exhibit them once in your apartment for the friends, and not exerting any pressure even then. And let’s not do anything else. There are lots of reasons for not stirring now. Besides, it won’t take long, I think I’ll be able to send it to you at the time of the exhibition or a little later. In the meantime it will dry thoroughly here, and I can go over all the canvases again once they’re thoroughly dry, even the impasted areas. If at the age of forty I do a painting of figures or portraits the way I feel it, I think that will be worth more than a more or less serious success now. The weather here is cold, but we see some really beautiful things all the same. Such as yesterday evening, a sickly lemon yellow sunset, mysterious, of extraordinary beauty — Prussian blue cypresses, trees with dead leaves in every broken tone against that, not half bad. More soon, and thanks once again for your kind letter. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b604 V/1968 Vincent thanks Theo for the 100 francs he sent, which must have been the third instalment of his November allowance. For this reason we have dated the letter to about Wednesday, 21 November 1888. The letter was bought by the Librairie de l'Abbaye, M. Lambert in Paris on 2 April 1963 at the sale held at the Hôtel Drouot in Paris. V.W. van Gogh bought it on 17 July 1963. Before this it belonged to Robert Rey, formerly a curator at the Musée du Luxembourg.  My dear Theo, I hope to persevere with this and be able to obtain more serious sittings, which can be paid for with portraits. In their work, it’s above all Madame Therèse and L’ami Fritz that I like.  I think we’ll end up spending our evenings drawing and writing, there’s more to work on than we can do. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b607 V/19My dear Theo Thank you very much for your letter, for the 100-franc note enclosed with it, and also the 50-franc money order. Indeed, there are bound to be grave difficulties still to overcome here, for him as well as for me. But these difficulties are rather within ourselves than elsewhere. All in all, I think personally that he’ll either definitely go or he’ll definitely stay. I told him to think and do his sums again before acting. Will he find it elsewhere if he doesn’t find it here? I’m waiting with absolute serenity for him to make a decision. Good handshake. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b612 V/19My dear Theo, That’s the stage we’re at. How I’d like you to see that museum in Montpellier some day, there are some really beautiful things there! As regards setting up a life with painters as pals, you see such odd things and I’ll end with what you always say, time will tell. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b611 V/1962 Following Merlhès, as well as Druick and Zegers, we have placed the visit to Montpellier on Sunday, 16 or Monday, 17 December. The railway journey lasted 2½ to 3 hours, so Van Gogh and Gauguin probably travelled back and forth in one day to avoid paying for a hotel. On Sunday and Monday the museum was open to the public both morning and afternoon, on Thursday only from 9.00 to 11.00. Although Baedeker also says that the museum was open ‘to foreign visitors on other days as well’ (encore les autres jours pour les étrangers), it is less likely that Van Gogh and Gauguin took advantage of this opportunity. See Baedeker 1889-2; Merlhès 1989, pp. 227, 228 (n. 1), and exhib. cat. Chicago 2001, pp. 390 (n. 256), 391 (n. 258, 259, 265). Where e’er I touched the earth, Upon my road there came to sit  A poor man dressed all in black As like to me as were we brothers. (Partout où j’ai touché la terre, Sur ma route est venu s’asseoir Un malheureux vêtu de noir Qui me ressemblait comme un frèreMy dear brother I expect to start work again soon. What wouldn’t I have given for you to see Arles in fine weather, now you have seen it when it’s dark. Handshake, I must go back to the hospital again, but shortly I’ll leave for good. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b613 V/19My dear Theo, Perhaps I won’t write you a really long letter today, but anyhow a line to let you know that I returned home today. How I regret that you were troubled for such a little thing, forgive me, for I am after all probably the primary cause of it. I hadn’t foreseen that it would lead to you being told about it. Enough. I just think that we must still keep calm regarding my own painting. If you want some I can certainly send them to you now, but when calm returns to me I hope to do something else. Ever yours, Vincent  My dear brother, Also you’ll see from this that I haven’t yet forgotten how to jest sometimes. I’m going to get back to work tomorrow, I’ll begin by doing one or two still lifes to get back into the way of painting. I can assure you that a few days in the hospital were very interesting, and that one perhaps learns how to live from the sick. But my appetite came back immediately, my digestion is good, and the blood is recovering day by day, and likewise serenity is returning to my mind day by day. So please deliberately forget your sad journey and my illness. Painting is the profession you know, and my goodness we’re perhaps not wrong to try to keep our hearts human. If I remain here it’s because I might not be able to transplant myself for the moment. After a little while we can review the pros and cons of the situation and do the calculations again. I shake your hand firmly.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b615 V/1962 (sheet 1) and b616 V/1962 (sheet My dear Theo, My fear that my indisposition might prevent your very necessary journey, which I’ve hoped for so much and for so long — now that this fear has disappeared I feel completely normal. When I came out of the hospital I had quite a few things to pay, and while they aren’t at all urgent for a few days, I’d be pleased if you could send me about fifty francs within the next few days. That worries me a little, for I’m not much inclined to have myself turned out of this house almost shamefully when it was I who had it repainted inside and out and had gas put in &c., in short who made habitable a house that had been locked up and uninhabited for quite a long time, and which I took on in very poor condition. This is to warn you that perhaps at Easter, for example, if the owner persists, I’ll ask you for advice about it, and that in all of this I consider myself merely an agent, defending the interests of our artist friends. Besides, it’s more than likely that water will flow under the bridge between now and then. And the main thing is not to worry about it. Handshake, and naturally you’ll feel how much I wish you good days with your fiancée. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b617 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Thanks for your kind letter and for the 50-franc note it contained. As to answering all your questions, can you do it yourself, at the moment I don’t feel up to it. On reflection I do indeed want to seek a solution, but I must re-read your letter again &c. In any case it has been completely lamentable, and indeed I would count myself fortunate if finally you might pay some serious attention to the way things are and have been for so long. But what can one do, unfortunately it’s complicated in several ways, my paintings are worthless, they cost me an extraordinary amount, it’s true, perhaps sometimes even in blood and brain. I won’t press the point, and what do you want me to say about it. Let’s get back in any case to the present month and speak only of money. Here are the expenses So this time again there’s no more serious harm than a little more suffering and relative anguish. And I retain all good hope. But I feel weak and a little anxious and fearful. Which will pass, I hope, as I regain my strength. Tomorrow morning when I’ve cleared this amount I’ll have left, net Fr. 23.50 It’s the 17th today, there are still 13 days left to get through. There you are, my dear brother, the account for the current month. It isn’t finished. Are the expenses thus wrongly incurred less than 200 francs? Unfortunately, that’s another expense, perhaps more sizeable than it should have been, but anyway, I glimpse hope in it. Mustn’t he, or at least shouldn’t he begin to see a little that we weren’t his exploiters, but that on the contrary we were anxious to safeguard his existence, his possibility of work and........ and... his integrity.  Why then not consider him as not responsible for the sorrows and damage which unconsciously he could have caused us in his blindness, you as much as me. If currently that thesis still seems too bold to you – I won’t press the point – but let’s wait and see. He’s had previous experience with what he calls ‘banking in Paris’ and believes that he’s clever at it... Perhaps you and I are decidedly not so very curious in that regard. Precisely to tell him to keep it between himself and me without disturbing you. He wouldn’t listen. It wearies me to recapitulate all this and calculate and recalculate things of this kind. I’ve tried in this letter to show you the difference that exists between my net expenses which come directly from me and those for which I am less responsible. I was sorry that just at that moment you should have those expenses, which were of no benefit to anyone. It’s a promotion for him, but it’s a very, very meagre consolation the government gives in this way to such an employee after so many years of work. I completely agree with you that we mustn’t meddle in doctors’ issues that have absolutely nothing to do with us. Naturally I didn’t speak of anything else, but what I said is that I would always regret not being a doctor, and that those who believe painting is beautiful would do well to see in it only a study of nature. He has more of a sense for balancing money for each day than I do. But his weakness is that by a sudden attack and animal-like impulse he upsets everything he was setting up. From time to time he and I have exchanged ideas on French art, on Impressionism... It now seems to me impossible, at least quite improbable, that Impressionism will organize itself and calm down. Why will the same not happen as happened in England at the time of the Pre-Raphaelites? And then do you remember Bompard in Numa Roumestan and his happy imagination? I’ll make haste to send him these childish things by parcel post. Hoping that he’ll never use more serious things. Handshake, I’ll read your letter again and will write to you soon about the other matters. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b618 a-c V/1962 On the basis of ll. 48-49: ‘today, 17 January’ (‘aujourd’hui 17 janvier’), the letter has been dated to Thursday, 17 January 188My dear Theo, I must write you another line today. Yesterday they also presented the gas bill for ten francs (or 9.90), which I also paid. That, added to the accounts I did for you in my previous letter, reduces to very, very little what I have left of the 50-franc note to feed myself. If you can, send me a bit more, I’ve explained everything about it clearly enough, I hope. And by doing thus what you must do, you’ll perhaps have more tranquillity than before, even amidst a thousand-and-one difficulties. What wouldn’t I have given to be able to spend a day here with you and to show you the work in progress and the house, &c. &c. Now I would prefer that you hadn’t yet seen anything of what I have here than to leave with an impression of it in such distressing conditions. Ah well. And the worst is that there isn’t much one can do about it, as soon as you put your hand in there you put it into a real wasps’ nest. Ever yours, Vincent. Naturally... The best thing he could still do and the very one which he won’t do. That would be quite simply to return here. Anyway, we haven’t got to that yet, for he doesn’t yet tell me that he glimpses penury on the horizon, only it’s more than readable between the lines. I’ll write to you again soon, but as for the monthly money, draw your own conclusions; I won’t spend more net than any other month. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b619 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Listen — what you know I’m trying to do, myself, is to recoup the money that my training as a painter has cost, neither more nor less. That’s my right, along with earning my bread each day. It would appear just to me that it should come back, I don’t say into your hands, since we’ve done what we’ve done together, and we find it so upsetting to talk of money. If I’m not yet busying myself with selling directly it’s because my tally of paintings isn’t yet complete, but it’s coming along and I’ve set to work again with this iron resolve. We’re all mortal and subject to all possible illnesses, what can we do about it when the latter aren’t precisely of a pleasant kind. The best thing is to try to recover from them. I still hope that perhaps, if we can’t make her meet and marry a doctor, we might at least perhaps be able to make her meet a painter. That, after your own marriage, would be what I would wish for now more than all the rest. Well, go straight ahead along that road. During my illness I again saw each room in the house at Zundert, each path, each plant in the garden, the views round about, the fields, the neighbours, the cemetery, the church, our kitchen garden behind — right up to the magpies’ nest in a tall acacia in the cemetery. Know only that I’ll be very happy when your marriage has taken place. ‘that — ... that’s... the flower’. I must finish for the moment. The delay in sending the money is sheer chance, and thus neither you nor I could do anything about it. Handshake. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b620 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Just a few words to tell you that I’m getting along so-so as regards my health and work. Which I already find astonishing when I compare my state today with that of a month ago. I well knew that one could break one’s arms and legs before, and that then afterwards that could get better but I didn’t know that one could break one’s brain and that afterwards that got better too. I still have a certain ‘what’s the good of getting better’ feeling in the astonishment that an ongoing recovery causes me, which I wasn’t in a state to dare rely upon. As it’s still winter, listen. Let me quietly continue my work, if it’s that of a madman, well, too bad. Then I can’t do anything about it. However, the unbearable hallucinations have stopped for now, reducing themselves to a simple nightmare on account of taking potassium bromide, I think. Only don’t be absolutely too amazed if, in the course of the coming month, I would be obliged to ask you for the month in full, and even the relative extra included. If I’m not mad the time will come when I’ll send you what I’ve promised you from the beginning. Now, these paintings may perhaps be fated for dispersal, but when you, for one, see the whole of what I want, you will, I dare hope, receive a consolatory impression from it. But although I’ll work during February and March, I’ll consider myself to be still ill, and I tell you in advance that in these two months I may have to take 250 a month from the year’s allowance. So, far from still remaining awkward with each other almost all the time because of that, we can feel like brothers again after that has been sorted out. You’ll have been poor all the time to feed me, but I’ll return the money or turn up my toes. My word, may the crisis come after that... Am I wrong about that, then? What I tell you is true: if it isn’t absolutely necessary to shut me away in a madhouse then I’m still good for paying what I can be considered to owe, at least in goods. Then, my dear brother, we have 89. The whole of France shivered at it and so did we old Dutchmen, with the same heart.  Alas there’s some truth in that, and that being the case let’s stay with the paintings. But to chuck me out they’d more likely get a kick in the backside, on this occasion at least. What can you say, we’ve gone all-out for the Impressionists, now as regards myself I’m trying to finish the canvases which will indubitably guarantee my little place that I’ve taken among them. My letter has become longer than I intended, it matters little – the main thing is that I ask categorically for two months’ work before settling what will need to be settled at the time of your marriage. As for me, with this little country here I have no need at all to go to the tropics. We are merely links in the chain. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b621 a-c V/1962 Whether or not Van Gogh, when mentioning the number 7, actually intended to hang the three Berceuses (B) with sunflowers (S) on either side – in the order S B S B S B S – is unclear. For another suggestion, see Dorn 1990, p. 30My dear Theo, From what people tell me I’m very obviously looking better; on the inside my heart is a little too full of so many diverse emotions and hopes, for it astonishes me that I’m getting better. My dear brother, in times to come we may indeed fall into suffering again, into errors, into misfortune, I don’t deny it. The weather today has been magnificent with no wind, and I wanted so much to work that I’m astonished by it, as I hadn’t expected it any more. Ever yours, Vincent I’ll expect your letter as early as possible after 1 February. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b622 V/19My dear Theo, What else can it do to us but bad things, and only cause us pain, you and me, if we aren’t well. Our ambition has sunk so low. So let’s work very calmly, look after ourselves as much as we can and not wear ourselves out in sterile efforts at reciprocal generosity. You’ll do your duty and I’ll do mine, as far as that’s concerned both of us have already paid for it other than in words and, at the end of the road, possibly we’ll see each other calmly again. But myself, whereas in my delirium all things I love so much are in turmoil, I can’t accept that as reality and am not acting the false prophet. Besides, there are so many people who think this way, in several categories of society, from the highest to the lowest. It will come back, really. The value of a painting in a case like this doesn’t come into it and I declare that I’m no expert. It remains that my social position may be as dear to me as yours as a good employee is to you. So I told him that I had no need of a lease, nor of a written statement of intent, preferably in writing, and that in the case of illness I would only pay by friendly agreement. Here the people have their hearts in the right place, and a spoken word is more binding than a written one. So I’m keeping the house for the time being, since I need to feel at home here for the sake of my mental recovery. I too am a little like that – to the local people who ask after my health I always say that I’ll begin by dying of it with them and that afterwards my sickness will be dead. That doesn’t mean to say that I won’t have considerable periods of respite. But once you’re seriously ill you well know that you can’t catch the sickness twice, being healthy or sick is the same thing as being young or old. The local people who are ill like me indeed tell me the truth. You can live to be old or young, but you’ll always have moments when you lose your head. So I don’t ask you to say of me that there’s nothing wrong with me, or won’t be. I’m closing this letter for this evening, with good handshake in thought. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b623 a-b V/19My dear Theo, The only desire I might have is to be able to continue to earn with my own hands what I spend. Let them go to Antibes, Nice, Menton, it’s perhaps healthier. Be well aware that you mustn’t preoccupy yourself with me too much, nor fret yourself. It must probably run its course, and we couldn’t change very much about our fate with precautions. Ever yours, Vincent Address next letter place Lamartine. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b624 V/19My dear Theo, Thanks very much for your kind letter and for the 50-franc note it contained. Is your own health reasonably good, and is the weather in Paris bearable? Will you see a bit of greenery there, in your new apartment? I hope so. Anyway, you can see that I don’t quite know what to think yet. Must however admit that in all the towns there are schools of drawing and masses of art lovers, but you understand that run by invalids or idiots of the fine arts it’s nothing but appearance and show. I believe also what you say, that if one day it was to take a graver turn one would have to follow what the doctors said, and I don’t oppose that. But that day may not be tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. At another moment, if I were less impressionable, I would probably poke a good deal of fun at what seems to me to be askew and deranged in the local customs. At present, from time to time it doesn’t have a very happy effect on me. Right, well – in fact, there are so many painters who are cracked in one way or another that little by little I’ll be consoled by it. What’s more, I’ll get along better if I know that you’re calm. Whatever happens, aren’t there a great many of us in France who try to remain calm whatever happens, adversity or prosperity? I shake your hand firmly in thought. You’re really kind to say that I could come to Paris, but I think that the bustle of a big city will never be worth anything to me. More soon. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b625 V/1919 March. My dear brother, Anyway, here I am, shut up for long days under lock and key and with warders in the isolation cell, without my culpability being proven or even provable. It goes without saying that in my heart of hearts I have a lot to say in reply to all that. It goes without saying that I shouldn’t get angry, and that apologizing would seem to me to be accusing myself in such a case. Only to warn you: to free me – first I don’t ask it, being sure that all of this accusation will be reduced to nothing. Only I say to you, you would find it difficult to free me. If I didn’t restrain my indignation I would immediately be judged to be a dangerous madman. In waiting let us hope, besides, strong emotions could only aggravate my state. That’s why I now ask you to promise to let them act without getting yourself mixed up in it. Consider yourself warned that it would perhaps complicate and confuse the matter. All the more so since you’ll understand that while I’m absolutely calm at the given moment, I may easily fall back into a state of over-excitement through new moral emotions. So you can imagine how much of a hammer-blow full in the chest it was when I found out that there were so many people here who were cowardly enough to band themselves together against one man, and a sick one at that. So I’m being patient. What misery – and all of it, so to speak, for nothing. Now, in all that, if I must resume my task of painting I naturally need my studio, the furniture, which we certainly can’t afford to renew if it’s lost. To be reduced once again to living in the hotel, you know that my work won’t allow it, I must have a fixed pied-à-terre. If these fellows here protest against me, I protest against them, and they just have to provide me with damages and interest in a friendly way, in short they just have to give me back what I would lose by their fault and ignorance. If – let’s say – I were to become definitively insane – certainly I don’t say that it’s impossible, in any case they should treat me differently, give me back the fresh air, my work &c. Ever yours, Vincent I have a vague memory of a registered letter from you for which I was made to sign but which I didn’t want to accept because they were making such a fuss for the signature, and of which I’ve since had no more news. I would have preferred not to write to you yet for fear of compromising you and disturbing you in what must work out above all. It will settle itself, it’s too idiotic to last. When you move house, address please. I hope that this reaches you in good condition. Let’s not fear, I’m quite calm now. Leave them to their own devices. You will perhaps do well to write one more time, but nothing more for the moment. If I’m patient, that could only make me stronger so that I won’t be so much in danger of relapsing into a crisis. Naturally I who really have done my best to be friends with the people and didn’t suspect it, it has been a harsh blow to me. More soon, I hope, my dear brother, don’t worry. It’s perhaps a sort of quarantine I’m being put through. What do I know? Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b626 a-b V/1962 Letter headed: ‘le 19 mars’. The subjects mentioned indicate that this must be Tuesday, 19 March 188My dear Theo, As far as I can judge I’m not mad, strictly speaking. Then perhaps it would have been good that I should accompany him where he’s going, and that the two of us could have sought a new place, but there, since that’s actually scarcely probable, what’s the good of him putting himself out expressly to come and see me? What I find excellent in your letter is that you say that one mustn’t on any account have illusions about life. But despite all that I don’t give a damn at all – were it not for the pain I’m quite involuntarily causing you thus, or rather that they’re causing – and for the delay in work &c. Anyway, all of that is nothing provided you walk straight towards your goal – once your home is secured, there’s a lot won for me too, and once that’s done we can perhaps rediscover a more peaceful path after your marriage. The best for me would certainly be not to remain alone, but I would prefer to remain eternally in a madhouse than to sacrifice another existence to my own. For the trade of painter is sad and bad these days. If I were a Catholic I could resort to making a monk of myself, but since I’m not exactly one, as you know, I don’t have that resort. The administration of the hospital is – how shall I put it – Jesuit, they’re very, very shrewd, very learned, very powerful, even Impressionistic... they know how to obtain information with an unheard-of subtlety – but – but – it astonishes and confuses me – yet... Anyway, there you have something of the cause of my silence, so stay apart from me for business matters, and in the meantime I am a man too, after all, you know, I’ll get by on my own, as regards what concerns me in matters of conscience. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b627 V/19My dear Theo, In my opinion we must squarely oppose the loss of the furniture &c. Then – my word – I must have my freedom to practise my profession.  But all I want to say is that this is above the question of sickness and health. Naturally one is beside oneself in parallel cases – I don’t say equivalent cases, as I have only a very inferior and secondary place – but I say parallel. And that was the first and last cause of my going out of my mind. Do you know that expression by a Dutch poet I am tied to the earth That’s what I experienced in many moments of anguish – above all – in my so-called mental illness. Unfortunately I have a profession which I don’t know well enough to express myself as I would wish. I’ll stop dead for fear of relapsing, and move on to something else. Could you send me before you leave Ah, if only nothing had happened to mess things up for me! You speak to me of what you call ‘the real south’. Above is the reason why I’ll never go there. I rightly leave that to people more complete, more entire than myself. As for me, I’m good only for something intermediate and second-rate and insignificant.  However much intensity my feeling may have or my power of expression may acquire, at an age when the material passions are more burned out – never can I build an imposing edifice on such a mouldy, shattered past. So I don’t really mind what happens to me – even staying here – I think that my fate will be balanced in the long term. Beware of sudden impulses – since you’re getting married, and I’m getting too old – it’s the only policy that can suit us. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b628 V/1962 Son gracieux docteur, l’interne Rey, croit que s’il avait une vie très methodique, mangeant et buvant normalement et à des heures régulières, il y aurait toutes les chances pour ne point se voir repetées ses terribles crises. Il est très disposé à le garder le temps qu’il faudra. Il pense que les frais de ce séjour doivent incomber à la municipalité, puisque c’est sur la demande de l’administration qu’il est gardé a l’hospice. En tous cas s’il ne revient pas à Paris, ce qui serait préférable de l’avis de M. Rey, il faudrait qu’il déménageat; son voisinage lui étant hostile. C’est aussi le souhait de votre frère qui voudrait etre sorti le plus tot possible de cet hospice où en somme il doit souffrir – de cette continuelle surveillance qui souvent doit être mesquine_– En résumé, je l’ai trouvé, je vous l’affirme, dans l’état le plus parfait de santé et de raison. Il ne souhaite qu’une chose, pouvoir travailler tranquillement. Faites donc en sorte de lui assurer ce bonheur. Combien cette vie lui doit être triste!) (FR b640). God grants the fullness of His best blessings; And sometimes gives poor mortal beings Both life’s zest and heavenly rest, Tying their hearts to the earth with more than earthly bonds. [God] schenkt de volheid van zijn beste zegeningen; En somtijds geeft Hij aan zijn arme stervelingen Ook levenslust bij hemelrust, En hecht hun hart aan de aard met meer dan aardsche banden. See De Génestet 1869, vol. 1, p. 13My dear Theo, But anyway, I’m trying to make an image such as a sailor who couldn’t paint would imagine it when he was in the middle of the sea and thought of a woman on land. They’re very, very attentive to me at the hospital these days, which — like many other things — mixes me up and makes me a little confused. Now I imagine that you’d prefer to marry without all the ceremonies and congratulations of a wedding, and am quite sure in advance that you’ll avoid them as much as possible. Certainly, you’re right after all, darned right — even allowing for hope, one probably has to accept the rather distressing reality. I hope to throw myself back completely into work, which has fallen behind. Ah, I mustn’t forget to tell you a thing I’ve often thought about. Utterly by chance, in an article in an old newspaper, I found a line written on an ancient tomb at Carpentras, near here. What does it mean, that ‘she never complained about anyone’? No, that doesn’t always produce a hard-on precisely, but anyway — from time to time in life one feels amazed, as if one was taking root in the ground. Is the ‘real south’ not to some degree the place where one might find a reason, a patience, a serenity sufficient to become like that good ‘Thebe — daughter of Telhui — priestess of Osiris — who never complained about anyone’? Beside that I feel like some kind of unworthy being. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b629 V/1962 The museum provides the following translation: ‘Blessed be you, Taba, daughter of Tahapi, who have achieved perfection with the god Osiris. You have done no evil deed and you have maligned no one on this earth. May Osiris in person bless you. Receive the waters in the house of Osiris. [Be received at the table of Osiris[?]. Pray, my love, and [be perfect[?] among souls dear to the god’. (Bénie sois-tu Taba, fille de Tahapi, parvenue à la perfection auprès du dieu Osiris. Tu n’as accompli aucune mauvaise action et tu n’as jamais calomnié personne sur cette terre. Qu’Osiris en personne te bénisse. Reçois les eaux chez Osiris. [Sois reçue à la table d’Osiris[?]. Prie, mon amour, et [sois parfaite[?] parmi les âmes chères au dieuMy dear Theo, I waited a few days before replying, not knowing which day you would leave for Amsterdam, besides I also don’t know whether it’s in Breda or Amsterdam that you’ll be getting married. But if, as I’m led to believe, it will be in Amsterdam, then I presumed that you would find this letter there around Sunday. I’m being forced to leave — all right — but to take away the gas — to make a fuss for damages or something else, certainly there would be justification but I don’t have the heart for it. The only thing that I find possible in this case is to tell ourselves that we’d have tried to set up a habitation for unknown successors. I’m well these days, apart from a certain vague background sadness that’s hard to define — but anyway — I’ve gained physical powers rather than lose them, and I’m working. At Easter I’ll have to pay 3 months’ rent, the removal costs &c. All that is neither cheering nor convenient. Especially since absolutely nothing promises us better luck. Write to me soon if you find the time. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b630 V/19My dear Theo, Now I hope that all these things have gone well for you. Also I still need Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b631 V/1962 It is not possible to give a more precise dating; on the basis of the information outlined above, we have dated the letter to between about Sunday, 14 and about Wednesday, 17 April 188My dear Theo Thanks very much for your kind letter and for the 100-franc note it contained. It would strain my mind a great deal to talk about it. It will, I hope, suffice to say that I feel decidedly incapable of starting to take a new studio again and living there alone, here in Arles or elsewhere – it comes down to the same thing – for the moment – I’ve nevertheless tried to make up my mind to begin again – for the moment not possible. I’d be afraid of losing the faculty of working, which is coming back to me now, by forcing myself to have a studio, and also having all the other responsibilities on my back. And for the time being I wish to remain confined, as much for my own tranquillity as for that of others. So there you have it, these days have been sad, moving house, transporting all my furniture, packing up the canvases which I’ll send you, but above all it seemed sad to me that all that had been given to me by you with so much brotherly affection, and that for so many years, it was however you alone who supported me, and then to be obliged to come back to tell you all this sad story... but it’s difficult for me to express that as I felt it. The kindness you have had for me isn’t lost, since you have had it and you still have it, so even if the material results should be nil, you still have that all the more, but I can’t say that as I felt it. But I would hope only that it – this recovery... The frightful superstition of certain people on the subject of alcohol, so that they prevail upon themselves never to drink or smoke. We’re already advised not to lie or steal and not to commit other great or small crimes, and it becomes too complicated if it was absolutely indispensable not to possess anything but virtues in a society in which we’re very indubitably rooted, be it good or bad. It would seem to me that with a boarding cost of around seventy-five francs a month there must be a way of confining me such that I have all I need. Then I’d very much wish, if the thing is possible, to be able to go out in the daytime to go and draw or paint outside. Seeing as I go out here every day now, and I think that may continue. I warn you that by paying more I’d be less happy. The company of the other sick people, you understand, isn’t at all disagreeable to me, on the contrary it distracts me. I shake your hand heartily in thought, I don’t know if I’ll write to you very, very often, because all my days aren’t clear enough to write somewhat logically. All your kindnesses for me, I’ve found them greater than ever today. And if we correspond a little less you’ll see that if she is as I think she is, she will console you. That’s what I hope. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b632 a-c V/19My dear Theo, I’m absent-minded, and for the moment wouldn’t be able to control my life. But let’s leave that aside as much as possible. How are you, are you back? I assure you that I’m much calmer now that I can tell myself that you have a companion for good. Above all, don’t imagine that I’m unhappy. Besides, as to my future, it isn’t as if I were 20, since I’ve passed 36. Thus I’d like to ask you a heap of things about Holland and about recent days. Poor egotist that I’ve always been and still am now, I can’t shake off this idea, which, however, I’ve already explained to you two or three times, that it’s thus for the best that I go into an asylum right now. It may return in the long run. Anyway, my very meagre excuse is that painting narrows ideas for the rest perhaps. One can’t be in one’s profession and think of the rest at the same time. It’s a little inevitable – the profession is quite thankless and its usefulness is certainly contestable. And the thing I regret is not having gone into an asylum sooner, it would have been simpler. Remains, however, the fact that the idea of association of painters, of housing them together, some of them, although we haven’t succeeded, although it’s a deplorable and painful failure – this idea remains true and reasonable – like so many others. Be well aware that we must take absolutely the simplest board and lodging. I’d like to write to you about other things, but it preoccupies me now that this matter should be sorted out, I can’t find the ideas I seek to write to you about on several things at once. More soon, I hope that you and your wife had a good journey. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b633 V/19My dear Theo, Now, if not, naturally as long as it goes well I can always paint or draw, which I do not refuse in the least. To come to Paris or to go to Pont-Aven I don’t feel up to it, besides I have no keen desire or keen regret most of the time. From time to time, just as the waves crush themselves against the deaf, desperate cliffs, a storm of desire to embrace something, a woman of the domestic hen type, but anyway one must take that for what it is, an effect of hysterical over-excitement rather than an accurate vision of reality. Ah, my dear Theo, if you could see the olive trees at this time of year... The old-silver and silver foliage greening up against the blue. And the orangeish ploughed soil. It’s something very different from what one thinks of it in the north – it’s a thing of such delicacy – so refined. It’s like the lopped willows of our Dutch meadows or the oak bushes of our dunes, that’s to say the murmur of an olive grove has something very intimate, immensely old about it. It’s too beautiful for me to dare paint it or be able to form an idea of it. I’ll send 2 crates of paintings by goods train shortly. You mustn’t feel awkward about destroying a good number of them. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b634 V/19My dear Theo, How I’d like to be able to pass on some physical strength to you, I have a feeling of having too much of it at the moment. Which doesn’t prevent my mind from not yet being at all what it ought to be. How sad it is to think that a painter who succeeds, even half succeeds, in his turn pulls along half a dozen artists who are even greater failures than himself. And what’s more, under the name of optimism we fall back into a religion which to me has the look of being the rear end of a kind of Buddhism. Nothing bad about that, quite the opposite, if you like. Today I’m packing up a crate of paintings and studies. That had an effect on me, not only the studio having foundered, but even the studies which would have been the memories of it damaged, it’s so final, and my urge to found something very simple but durable was so strong. It was fighting against insurmountable odds, or rather it was weakness of character on my part, for I still have feelings of grave remorse difficult to define. I think that was the cause of my crying out so much during the crises, that I wanted to defend myself and could no longer manage to. For it wasn’t for me, it was for the very painters like the unfortunate one spoken of in the enclosed article that this studio could have been of use. Now, though, I assure you that I know no hospital where one would want to take me for nothing, even supposing that I would take upon myself the expenses of my painting and would leave all my work to the hospital. And that is perhaps, I don’t say a great but anyway a small injustice. I would be resigned if I thought that. If I was without your friendship I would be sent back without remorse to suicide, and however cowardly I am, I would end up going there. There, as you will see I hope, is the point where we’re permitted to protest against society and to defend ourselves. So this information is bad indeed. If I could get out of it by enlisting for 5 years in the Foreign Legion, I think I’d prefer that. For on the one hand being locked up, not working I would recover with difficulty, on the other hand we’d be made to pay 100 francs a month all through a madman’s long life. I say this just in case; you shouldn’t blame me too much if I go. The rest is so vague and so strange. And you know how doubtful it is that one ever recovers what it costs to do painting. Besides, it seems to me that physically I am well. Certainly in the barracks I could then work as well and even better. Ever yours, Vincent This is what I consider worthy of being put on stretching frames in the consignment. If there’s room in the crate I’ll add some stretching frames. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b635 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b636 V/19My dear Theo, Anyway, all in all what does it matter to you or to me to have a little more or a little less annoyance. I have a certain hope that with what I know of my art in total, a time will come when I’ll produce again, although in the asylum. What use would the more artificial life of an artist in Paris be to me – one by which, all in all, I would only be half duped and for which I consequently lack primitive enthusiasm, indispensable for launching myself into it. Physically it’s amazing how well I am, but that isn’t enough of a basis for going on believing that it’s the same mentally. I would happily, once I was known there a little, try and make myself a male nurse little by little, in short to work at anything and take up an occupation again – the first one that comes along. Madness is salutary for this, that one becomes perhaps less exclusive. I don’t regret having wanted to know a little technically about this question of the theories of colours. As an artist one is merely a link in a chain, and whether you find or you don’t find, you can console yourself with that. Ever yours, Vincent Crinolines also had something pretty and consequently good about them, but anyway the fashion was fortunately short-lived all the same. Not for some people. And thus we’ll always retain a certain passion for Impressionism, but I sense that I’m returning more and more to the ideas I already had before coming to Paris. Now that you’re married we no longer have to live for great ideas but, believe it, for little ones only. And I find that a real relief which I don’t complain about at all. They have a lot of room here at the hospital, there’d be enough to make studios for thirty or so painters. I really must make up my mind, it’s only too true that an awful lot of painters go mad, it’s a life which makes you very distracted, to say the least. If I throw myself fully into work again, that’s good, but I still remain cracked. If I could enlist for 5 years I would recover considerably and would be more rational and more the master of myself. But one or the other, it’s all the same to me. If I hadn’t been in such a hurry, if I’d kept my studio, this summer I would have worked again on all the canvases I’ve sent you. As long as the impasto isn’t dry all the way through, naturally it can’t be scraped. Original manuscript (sheet 1, 3); reproduction (sheet 2) Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b637 a-b V/1962 (sheet 1, 3); location of sheet 2 unknown Van Gogh’s remark about the woman refers to the 22-year-old La Fosseuse, an orphan whom Benassis has taken under his wing. Both of them have had much misfortune in their lives. La Fosseuse is plagued by mood swings and is extremely sensitive to natural beauty. She has a weak constitution and suffers from all kinds of complaints, mostly caused by her nervous condition. Theo’s estate contains a copy of this novel, published in 1884 by Calmann-Lévy in Paris. It cannot be ascertained whether this copy ever belonged to VincenMy dear Theo, The idea of my duty to work comes back to me a lot, and I believe that all my faculties for work will come back to me quite quickly. It’s just that work often absorbs me so much that I think I’ll always be absent-minded and awkward in getting by for the rest of life too. Handshake, and ever yours, Vincent Thanks very much for your letter, in which I above all looked for news of my brother. And I find it very good. I can see that you have already observed that he loves Paris and that this surprises you a little, you who don’t like it, or rather who above all like the flowers there, such as, I suppose, for example, the wisterias which are probably beginning to flower. Could it not be the case that in liking a thing one sees it better and more accurately than in not liking it. For him and for me Paris is certainly already a cemetery in a way, where many artists have perished, whom we knew directly or indirectly. Although there are a few people here who are seriously ill, the fear, the horror that I had of madness before has already been greatly softened. I shall count myself very happy if I manage to work enough to earn my living, for it makes me very worried when I tell myself that I’ve done so many paintings and drawings without ever selling any. Don’t be in too much of a hurry to consider this an injustice, I don’t know anything at all about it. Thanking you again for writing to me, and being very happy to know that now my brother doesn’t return to an empty apartment when he comes home in the evening, I shake your hand in thought, and believe me your brother Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b638 V/1962 Pickvance dated the letter to about Wednesday, 15 May, but we think it unlikely that Van Gogh would wait so long to inform them of his arrival in Saint-Rémy, especially since Theo had asked about it in his previous letter (see exhib. cat. New York 1986, p. 27My dear Theo, You must know, too, that if you put them in this order: Here’s a new no. 30 canvas, commonplace again, like one of those chromos from a penny bazaar that depict eternal nests of greenery for lovers. It’s just a question — which is unfortunately lacking in chromos from a penny bazaar and barrel organs — of putting in some style. With this — as there are more than 30 empty rooms — I have another room in which to work. The food is so-so. It smells naturally a little musty, as in a cockroach-ridden restaurant in Paris or a boarding school. As these unfortunates do absolutely nothing (not a book, nothing to distract them but a game of boules and a game of draughts) they have no other daily distraction than to stuff themselves with chickpeas, haricot beans, lentils and other groceries and colonial foodstuffs by the regulated quantities and at fixed times. Well, now I think of all this without fear, i.e. I find it no more atrocious than if these people had snuffed it of something else, of consumption or syphilis, for example. These artists, I see them take on their serene bearing again, and do you think it’s a small thing to rediscover ancient members of the profession. Joking apart, that’s what I’m profoundly grateful for. If someone has some crisis the others look after him, and intervene so that he doesn’t harm himself. The same for those who have the mania of often getting angry. Old regulars of the menagerie run up and separate the fighters, if there is a fight. My hope would be that at the end of a year I’ll know better than now what I can do and what I want. Then, little by little, an idea will come to me for beginning again. Coming back to Paris or anywhere at the moment doesn’t appeal to me at all, I feel that I’m in the right place here. In my opinion, what most of those who have been here for years are suffering from is an extreme sluggishness. Now, my work will preserve me from that to a certain extent. It’s a shame that you yourself are still condemned to Paris, and that you never see the countryside other than that around Paris. I think that it’s no more unfortunate for me to be in the company where I am than for you always the fateful things at Goupil & Cie. From that point of view we’re quite equal. For only in part can you act in accordance with your ideas. Since, however, we have once got used to these inconveniences, it becomes second nature. I think that although the paintings cost canvas, paint &c., at the end of the month, however, it’s more advantageous to spend a little more thus, and to make them with what I’ve learned in total, than to abandon them while one would have to pay for board and lodging all the same anyway. And that’s why I’m making them. So this month I have 4 no. 30 canvases and two or three drawings. I retain my duties in that respect as much as anyone. And perhaps some day I’ll be in a position to repay all that I’ve spent, because I consider that what I’ve spent is, if not taken from you at least taken from the family, so consequently I’ve produced paintings and I’ll do more. That is to act as you too act yourself. If I had private means, perhaps my mind would be freer to do art for art’s sake, now I content myself with believing that in working assiduously even so, without thinking of it one perhaps makes some progress. Here are the colours I would need Ever yours, Vincent. Previous text publication, reproduction and original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b639 V/1962 (sheet 2)My dear Theo, I still have to ask you to send me a few ordinary brushes as soon as possible, of more or less these sizes Half a dozen of each please. As for me, my health is good, and as for the head it will, let’s hope, be a matter of time and patience. I still have remorse, and enormously when I think of my work, so little in harmony with what I’d have wished to do. I hope that in the long run it will make me do better things, but we aren’t there yet. I’ve been here almost a whole month, not one single time have I had the slightest desire to be elsewhere; just the will to work again is becoming a tiny bit firmer. I don’t notice any very clear desire to be elsewhere in the others either, and this may very well come from the fact that one feels too decidedly broken for life outside. What I don’t really understand is their absolute idleness. But that’s the great defect of the south, and its ruin. But what a beautiful land and what beautiful blue and what a sun. And yet I’ve only seen the garden and what I can make out through the window. I hope that you’ll destroy a heap of things that are too bad in the heap I sent, or at least will only show the most passable ones. Since it’s just the season when there are lots of flowers and thus colour effects, it will perhaps be wise to send me another 5 metres of canvas in addition. For the flowers will be short-lived and will be replaced by the yellow wheatfields. The latter, above all, I would like to capture better than in Arles. The mistral (since there are a few mountains here) appears far less annoying than in Arles, where you always get it at first hand. More soon, good handshake in thought to you and to Jo. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b641 V/19My dear Theo, I was very glad of it, for I was pining for work a little. Also, for a few days now I’ve been going outside to work in the neighbourhood. When the thing depicted is stylistically absolutely in agreement and at one with the manner of depiction, isn’t that what creates the quality of a piece of art? The thing is, among the number of things that one makes there are always some that one has felt or wanted more and which one wants to keep all the same. When I see a painting that intrigues me, I can never help asking myself, ‘in what house, room, corner of the room, in whose home would it do well, would it be in its rightful place’. Now the Impressionists – once again, if an interior isn’t complete without a work of art, neither is a painting if it isn’t at one with original surroundings, resulting from the era in which it was produced. And I don’t know if the Impressionists are worth more than their time, or rather aren’t yet worth as much. I’m bored to death at times after work, and yet I have no desire to begin again. The doctor who has just come by says that he won’t be going to Paris for a few weeks yet, so don’t expect his visit for the time being. I hope that you’ll write to me soon. This month I’ll again really be in need of Only you can count on the fact that I’m doing everything I can to become active and perhaps useful again, in this sense at least, that I want to do better paintings than before. Above all write to me soon, for your letter is very slow in coming, I hope that you’re well. It’s a great consolation for me to know that you’re no longer living alone. Then I feel tempted to begin again with the simpler colours, the ochres for example. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b642 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I would have very much liked to know if you now still eat together at the restaurant or if you live at home more. I hope so, for in the long run that must be the best. So in any case, I am worse and more blameworthy than they are in that regard (causing a stir quite involuntarily, my word). You’ll give me a lot of pleasure if you write to me again soon. I so often think that after a while you’ll find in marriage, I hope, the means to gain new strength, and that a year from now your health will have improved. Now, whatever is too bad in the consignment, put it completely to one side, pointless to have stuff like that; it may be of use to me later to remind me of things. Whatever is good will show up better by being part of a smaller number of canvases. The rest, if you put them in a corner, flat between two sheets of cardboard with old newspapers between the studies, that’s all they’re worth. I’m sending you a roll of drawings. Ever yours, Vincent Don’t be afraid that I would ever venture onto dizzy heights of my own free will, unfortunately, whether we like it or not, we’re subject to circumstances and to the illnesses of our time. But with all the precautions I’m now taking, it will be difficult for me to relapse, and I hope that the attacks won’t start again. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b643 V/19My dear Theo, As for me, my health is still very good. And work is distracting me. It’s beautiful as regards lines and proportions, like an Egyptian obelisk. And the green has such a distinguished quality. To do nature here, as everywhere, one must really be here for a long time. Naturally it will please me if you send me the colours, soon if that’s possible, but above all do what you can without it exhausting you too much. So if you prefer to send me it in two batches, that’s also all right. That will keep me busy for the next few days. Finding something to do all day is the big thing here. What a pity that one can’t move the building here. It would be magnificent to hold an exhibition there, all the empty rooms, the big corridors. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b644 V/19My dear Theo, At the same time, having married a Dutchwoman, that could in a few years, sooner or later, warm up business relations with Amsterdam or The Hague again. And then it would appear that waging a battle seven times a week couldn’t go on. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b645 V/19I very much like to believe that illnesses sometimes cure us, i.e. that when the illness comes to a crisis it’s a thing necessary to the recovery of a normal state of body. No, subsequent to the marriage he’ll regain his strength, still having the reserve of youth and power to restore him. I’m very pleased that he’s no longer alone, and truly I don’t doubt that he’ll regain his former temperament after a while. And then above all when he’s a father and the feeling of fatherhood comes to him, that will be a considerable gain. In my life as a painter, and above all when I’m in the country, it’s not so difficult for me to be alone, because in the country one feels the bonds that unite us all more easily. But in town, as he has done his ten consecutive years with the Goupils in Paris, it isn’t possible to live alone. So with patience it will return. Only instead of paying money to a landlord we’re giving it to the asylum, I don’t see the difference – and it’s scarcely cheaper. The work is a thing apart, and has always cost me a lot. More soon, but I wanted to write to you straightaway that this morning’s news gives me great pleasure. Handshakes and Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b647 V/1962 ‘You few that lov’d me, And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham, His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave Is only bitter to him, only dying; Go with me like good angels to my end, And as the long divorce of steel falls on me, Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on a’ God’s name.’ The manipulative Cardinal Wolsey (1471-1530), Archbishop of York, loses his wealth and power when his crimes are revealed. He forfeits his royal protection and is attacked from all sides. Full of remorse, Wolsey addresses his servant with great emotion (act 3, scene 2): ‘And when I am forgotten, as I shall be, And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention Of me more must be heard of, say I thaught thee; Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory, And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour, Found thee a way (out of his wrack) to rise in ... Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition, By that sin fell the angels; how can man then, The image of his maker, hope to win by it? Love thyself last, cherish those hearts that hate thee; Corruption wins not more than honestyMy dear Theo, Tomorrow I’ll send you a roll of canvases by goods train. There are four of them, i.e. the following I’m also enclosing another 7 studies which are dry but which are studies after nature rather than subjects for paintings. And that’s how it always is, you have to do several of them before you find a whole with character. Now here are the subjects of these 7 studies. Now the next consignment, which will follow shortly, will consist mainly of wheatfields and olive groves. Write me a line soon. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b648 V/19My dear Theo, Truly, I’m so pleased with the fact that if sometimes there are cockroaches in the food here, in your home there is wife and child. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b651 V/1962 (sheet 1) and inv. no. d145 V/1971 (sheet 2) Pickvance also identified this ‘large study of an orchard’ as F 511, but said that this passage suggests that Van Gogh made a second version of it, F 512. This work, however, is not considered authentic and was not included in the catalogues raisonnés. Moreover, by ‘reworking’ Van Gogh must have meant ‘resume working on’ (namely the same work) and not ‘re-doing’ it in the sense of painting a second version. Cf. exhib. cat. New York 1986, p. 37; incidentally, on p. 296 Pickvance says, incorrectly, that F 511 is the enclosed ‘variation’. Dorn 1990, p. 467, adopts Pickvance’s identificatioMy dear Theo, I no longer see any possibility for courage or good hope, but anyway it wasn’t yesterday that we found out that this profession isn’t a happy one. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b649 V/1962 The letter is written in black chalMy dear Theo, Since I wrote to you I’m feeling better, and whilst I don’t know if it’ll last I don’t want to wait any longer to write to you again. Work distracts me infinitely better than anything else, and if I could once really throw myself into it with all my energy that might possibly be the best remedy. The impossibility of having models, a heap of other things, prevent me from managing it however. Anyway, I really must try to take things a little passively and be patient. Were I independent and free, I would nevertheless have retained my enthusiasm, for there are some really beautiful things to do. But will he have a firm opinion, has he written anything definite to you?? And possible? You can see that I’m still in a very bad mood, it’s because things aren’t going well. Then I consider myself imbecilic to go and ask doctors for permission to make paintings. Besides, it’s to be hoped that if I recover sooner or later, up to a certain point it’ll be because I’ve cured myself by working, which fortifies the will and consequently allows these mental weaknesses less hold. My dear brother, I wanted to write to you better than this, but things aren’t going very well. I have a great desire to go into the mountains to paint for whole days, I hope they’ll allow me to in the coming days. And as for me, who feels it and can’t damned well do anything, isn’t that sickening. And I’ll always regret that in our times people believe in the incompatibility of the generation of, say, 48 and the present one. I myself believe that the two hold their own all the same, though I can’t prove it. Ah – the rest of us would have to get old working hard, and that’s why we then get despondent when things don’t go right. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b650 a-b V/1962 When, in late autumn, the two vines showed their white and blue grapes through the bright green foliage, we would stop, every child, on the road to school, in front of the pretty little house’ (De chaque côté de sa porte grimpait une vigne dont les rameaux entrelacés entouraient les fenêtres de festons, et couvraient si complétement la façade peinte en bleu et les tuiles rouges du toit, qu’on eût cru voir un berceau de verdure. Lorsque, dans l’arrière-saison, les deux vignes montraient leurs raisins blancs et bleus à travers le feuillage d’un vert éclatant, nous nous arrêtions, tout enfant, sur le chemin de l’école, devant la jolie maisonnette) (ed. Paris 1882, pp. 1-2). The description of the surroundings is something that Van Gogh himself might have penneMy dear brother, You’ve taken some excellent stretching frames, damn it, if I had some like that here to work on that would be better than these strips of wood from here that warp in the sun. Then I’m retouching some studies from this summer – anyway I’m working from morning till night. Strength is coming back to me day by day, and once again it seems to me that I already have almost too much of it. For to remain hard-working at the easel it isn’t necessary to be a Hercules. This inevitability of suffering and despair – anyway, here I am again, recovered for a period – I’m thankful for it. My dear brother – I’m still writing to you between bouts of work – I’m ploughing on like a man possessed, more than ever I have a pent-up fury for work, and I think that this will contribute to curing me. Since I myself don’t forget the inspiration that I gain from giving free rein to my memories of certain Belgians. That’s the positive thing, and the rest is so secondary. And here we are in September already, we’ll soon be in the middle of autumn, and then winter. I’ll carry on working very hard, and then if the crisis returns towards Christmas we’ll see, and once that’s over then I wouldn’t see any disadvantage in sending the management here to all the devils and coming back to the north for a fairly long time. Leaving now would perhaps be too unwise, when I consider a new crisis likely in the winter, i.e. in 3 months. I haven’t set a foot outside for 6 weeks, not even in the garden.\n",
      "I’ll try, though, next week, when I’ve finished the canvases in progress. But another few months and I’ll be so flabby and stupefied that a change will probably do a lot of good. That, for the moment, is my idea on the subject, of course it isn’t a fixed idea. But am of the opinion that we shouldn’t put ourselves out any more with the people of this establishment than with the owners of a hotel. We’ve rented a room from them for a certain amount of time, and they’re well paid for what they give, and that’s absolutely all.  Not to mention the fact that perhaps they’d like nothing better than for the situation to be chronic, and one would be culpably stupid if one gave in to them on that. For my taste, they make far too many enquiries about not only what I but you earn &c. I’m struggling with all my energy to master my work, telling myself that if I win this it will be the best lightning conductor for the illness. I take great care of myself by carefully shutting myself away; it’s selfish if you like, not to become accustomed to my companions in misfortune here instead, and to go to see them, but anyway I feel none the worse for it, for my work is progressing and we have need of that, for it’s more than necessary that I do better than before, which wasn’t sufficient. Isn’t it better that if I were to come back from here again, sooner or later, I come back decidedly capable of doing a portrait that has some character, than to come back as I left? It’s coarsely expressed, for I really feel that one can’t say ‘I can do a portrait’ without telling a lie, because that is infinite. But anyway you’ll understand what I want to say, that I must do better than before. I’m even inclined to believe that the portrait will tell you better than my letter how I am, and that it will reassure you – it cost me some trouble. And then the reaper is working too I think – it’s very, very simple. Anyway later – perhaps my journey into the south will bear fruit however, because the difference of the stronger light, the blue sky, that teaches one to see, and then above all and even only when one sees that for a long time. I must ask you for the following painting items. Good handshake to you and Jo. Ever yours, Vincent It’s very serious that wherever I were to stay here for a little longer I would perhaps come up against popular prejudices – I don’t even know what these prejudices are – which would make my life with them unbearable. With another year’s work, perhaps I’ll arrive at a feeling of self-security from the artistic point of view. And that’s always something worth seeking. But for that I must have good luck. What I dream of in my best moments aren’t so much dazzling colour effects as the half-tones once again. But in these half-tones what choice and what quality! It’s time for me to send off this letter at last – I could tell you in two pages what it contains, i.e. nothing new. But anyway, I don’t have time to redo it. Good handshake once again, and if it doesn’t put you out too much let me have the canvas as soon as possible. Ever yours, V. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b652 a-d V/19My dear Theo, Do you know that today, still, when I read by chance the story of some energetic industrialist or above all a publisher, that the same feelings of indignation then come to me again, the same feelings of anger from the old days when I was with G.&Cie. Life goes on like that, time doesn’t come back, but I’m working furiously, because of the very fact that I know that the opportunities to work don’t come back. My dear brother, you know that I came to the south and threw myself into work for a thousand reasons. Will you then understand that while finding my illness horrible I feel that all the same I’ve entered into attachments that are a little too strong here – attachments which could mean that later on the desire to work here will take hold of me again – while all the same it may well be that I’ll return to the north relatively soon. Yes, for I don’t hide from you the fact that in the same way that I’m taking my food avidly at present, I have a terrible desire that comes to me to see my friends again and to see the northern countryside again. But he’s very kind and very indulgent towards me, and whilst he isn’t the absolute master here, far from it, I owe him many freedoms. However, I know quite well that recovery comes, if one is brave, from inside, through the great resignation to suffering and death, through the abandonment of one’s own will and one’s self-love. But it’s not coming to me, I love to paint, to see people and things and everything that makes up our life – artificial – if you like. Yes, real life would be in something else, but I don’t think I belong to that category of souls who are ready to live and also at any moment ready to suffer. Ah, I’ll never be able to render my impressions of certain figures I’ve seen here. Certainly the road to the south is the road where there’s something brand new, but men of the north have difficulty in getting through. And I can see myself already in advance, on the day when I have some success, longing for my solitude and distress here when I see the reaper in the field below through the iron bars of the isolation cell. Every cloud has a silver lining. To succeed, to have lasting prosperity, one must have a temperament different from mine, I’ll never do what I could have and ought to have wanted and pursued. As soon as I read that I had this idea of asking you if there would be a way of going to stay with him. If you pay him the same thing as here, he’ll find it worth his while, for I don’t need much – except for working. The emotions that that causes are too strong though, I wouldn’t survive it – but later, later, I don’t say that I won’t mount a fresh attack. My strength has been exhausted too quickly, but I can see from afar the possibility for others to do an infinity of beautiful things. And again and again that idea remains true, that to facilitate the journey of others it would have been good to found a studio somewhere in these parts. Ever yours, Vincent In the long run here I would lose the faculty to work, now there I begin to call a halt, and so I’ll send them packing, if you agree. And paying for it what’s more, no, then one or the other of the artists fallen in misfortune will consent to set up house with me. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b653 a-c V/19My dear Theo, You’ll see that there are other possibilities, if not there then elsewhere. Now business is business, and you ask me to answer categorically – and you’re right to do so – if I would consent to go into an asylum in Paris in the event of moving immediately for this winter. But that being said, I’ll point out to you that in my letter I gave a very serious motive as a reason for wishing to move. On the assumption that, very sensitive to surroundings, the already prolonged stay in these old cloisters which are the Arles hospital and the home here would be sufficient in itself to explain these crises – then – even as a stopgap – it might be necessary to go into a lay asylum at present. As regards eating a lot, I’m doing so – but if I was my doctor I would forbid it. Not seeing any good for myself in really enormous physical strength, for if I absorb myself in the idea of doing some good work and wanting to be an artist and nothing but that, that would be the most logical thing. I can assure you that it interests me enormously to make copies, and that not having any models for the moment it will ensure, however, that I don’t lose sight of the figure. What’s more, it will give me a studio decoration for myself or another. I would like also to copy the Sower and the Diggers. You’ll be surprised what effect the Travaux des champs take on in colour, it’s a very intimate series of his. Good – since I’m above all ill at present, I’m trying to do something to console myself, for my own pleasure. Heaps of people don’t copy. Heaps of others do copy – for me, I set myself to it by chance, and I find that it teaches and above all sometimes consoles. The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect – And yet what similarities there are in their work. That one came very close to being an excellent painter. It’s money troubles with him, in order to eat he’s forced to do a thousand things other than painting, which costs him more money than it brings in when he makes something beautiful. Do you know what I think about quite often – what I used to say to you back in the old days, that if I didn’t succeed I still thought that what I had worked on would be continued. Not directly, but one isn’t alone in believing things that are true. And what does one matter as a person then? I feel so strongly that the story of people is like the story of wheat, if one isn’t sown in the earth to germinate there, what does it matter, one is milled in order to become bread. Even in the face of an illness that’s unsettling or worrying, this belief is absolutely unshaken. It’s a great advance that my stomach is working well, and so I don’t think that I’ll be as sensitive to the cold. Then I know what to do when the weather is bad, as I have this plan to copy several things that I like. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b655 a-b V/19My dear Theo, I’m dropping you another line to explain that 3 studies are missing from the consignment of canvases (which you will have already), since by removing them the roll cost 3.50 francs less for carriage. So I’ll send them next opportunity – or rather they’re leaving today with other canvases – the following. You’ll see that I’m gaining a little patience, and that persevering will be a result of my illness. I feel more detached from many preoccupations. You’ll send me one day, when it suits you, the red vineyard and other canvases with that aim when you’ve seen the 5 that I’ve done. For there are fine autumnal effects to do. At present I feel completely normal and no longer remember those bad days at all. With work and very regular food this will probably last for quite a long time, so-so, and I’ll also do my work all the same without it appearing. For at the end of the month you’ll receive another dozen studies. Am I mistaken, but it seems to me that your letter is very delayed this time? Handshakes. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b656 V/19My dear Theo, I’m using two colours here, lead white and ordinary blue, but in quite large quantities, and the canvas, that’s for when I want to work on unprepared, stronger canvas. This comes unfortunately just at this time when I would gladly have repeated my trip to Arles etc. And now that I’m staying on here for the time being, and will most probably spend the winter here – in the spring – in the fine season, shall I not stay here too? That will depend on my health above all. But anyway, for the moment there’s therefore nothing that’s absolutely hurrying us. But what does he want to say now when the olive trees, the fig trees, the vineyards, the cypresses must be more accentuated, all characteristic things, the same as the Alpilles, which must get more character. It wasn’t without great faults, but there was simplicity in it, and how sad it is to see how much they have degenerated from it here, as we have from ours in Holland. I’m writing to you in haste so as not to wait to answer your kind letter, hoping that you’ll write again without delaying long. I’ve seen more very beautiful subjects for tomorrow – in the mountains. Shaking both your hands, believe me Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b657 V/19My dear Theo, I hope that you’ll have received the canvases sent about ten days ago in good order. I’m going off for a long hike in the mountains to look for sites. More soon – above all send the paint and the canvas if it hasn’t been sent, for I’ve no canvas left at all, nor any zinc white. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b658 V/19My dear Theo, However, melancholy very often overtakes me with great force, and besides, the more my health returns to normal the more my mind is capable of reasoning very coldly, the more to do painting that costs us so much and doesn’t bring in anything, not even the cost of producing them, seems madness to me, a thing completely against reason. Then I feel utterly sad, and the bad thing is that at my age it’s darned difficult to start again with something else. Perhaps I’d be more useful doing that than through my own painting. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b659 V/19My dear Theo, Enclosed I’m sending you a list of colours I need as soon as possible. Now that most of the leaves have fallen the landscape looks more like the north, and then I really feel that if I went back to the north I would see it more clearly than before. Health is a big thing, and a lot depends on it, as regards work too. Fortunately those abominable nightmares no longer torment me. I hope to go to Arles in the next few days. I’m so happy that you’re no longer alone, and that everything’s more normal than before. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b661 V/1962 The order for paints that Van Gogh enclosed in this letter has not been preserveMy dear Theo,  If I’d known in time that there were trains from here to Paris at only 25 francs I would certainly have come. It’s only on going to Arles that I found this out, and it’s because of the expense that I haven’t done it – at the moment it would seem to me that in springtime it would however be good to come in any event to see the people and things of the north again. For this life here is terribly numbing, and in the long run I’d lose my energy. I had hardly dared hope that I would still be as well as is the case.  If my health remains stable, then if while I’m working I again start to try to sell, exhibit, make exchanges, perhaps there’ll be some progress so as to be less of a burden to you on the one hand and to regain a little more zest on the other. For I don’t hide from you the fact that my stay here is very tiring on account of its monotony, and because the society of all these unfortunates, who do absolutely nothing, gets on one’s nerves.  But what can one do, one can’t have pretensions in my case, I already have too many as it is.  Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b662 V/19My dear Theo, I hope I’ll get used to working in the cold – in the morning there are very interesting effects of white frost and fog, and I still have the great desire to do for the mountains and for the cypresses what I’ve just done for the olive trees, have a really good go at them. I’m completely at the end of my canvas, and when you can please send me 10 metres. Then I’m going to attack the cypresses and the mountains. I think that this must be the centre of the work I’ve done here and there in Provence, and then we can conclude the stay here when it’s convenient. Which isn’t urgent, for Paris only distracts, after all. I don’t know, though, not always being a pessimist – I keep telling myself that I still have it in my heart to paint a bookshop one day with the shop window yellow-pink, in the evening, and the passers-by black – it’s such an essentially modern subject. Because it also appears such a figurative source of light. I say, that would be a subject that would look good between an olive grove and a wheatfield, the sowing of books, of prints. I have that very much in my heart to do, like a light in the darkness. Yes, there’s a way of seeing Paris as beautiful. But anyway, bookshops aren’t hares, and there’s no hurry, and I have a good will to work here for another year, which will probably be wiser. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b664 V/1962 and b2970 V/1982 (envelope) An extant envelope probably belonged to the present letter, because it bears writing in another hand, which says: ‘Superb letter to be reproduced almost in its entirety. The olive trees’. In the present letter Van Gogh treats this subject in detail. The envelope is postmarked 26 November, so we have dated the letter to Tuesday, 26 November 188My dear Theo, In spite of the cold I’m continuing to work outside up to now, and I think that it’s good for me and for the work. You’ll see that there are no more impastos in the large studies. I prepare the thing with sorts of washes with spirits, and then proceed with touches or hatchings of colour with spaces between them. This imparts atmosphere and uses less paint. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b667 V/19My dear Theo, As regards winter clothing, what I have isn’t very much, as you’ll understand, but it’s warm enough and so we can wait until spring with that. If I go out it’s to work, so then I put on the most worn-out things I have, and I have a velvet waistcoat and trousers for here. In the spring, if I’m here, I’m planning to go and make a few paintings in Arles as well, and if I get something new around then, that will suffice. I’m sending you enclosed an order for canvas and colours, but I still have some and it can wait until next month if this one is too heavily burdened already. I regret not being able to send the olive trees one of these days, but it’s drying so badly that I’ll have to wait. I shake your hand warmly in thought, I’m going to work some more outside, the mistral’s blowing. It usually dies down by the time the sun’s about to set, then there are superb effects of pale citron skies, and desolate pines cast their silhouettes into relief against it with effects of exquisite black lace. At other times the sky is red, at other times a tone that’s extremely delicate, neutral, still pale lemon but neutralized by delicate lilac. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b666 V/19My dear brother, Now what you say about my work certainly is agreeable to me, but I still think of this bloody profession in which one is caught as if in a net and in which one becomes less practical than others. Anyway, useless alas to fret about this – and one must do as one can. Odd that I’d worked perfectly calmly on canvases that you’ll soon see, and that all at once, without any reason, the confusion took hold of me again. For the crowding together of all these lunatics in this old cloister is, I believe, becoming a dangerous thing in which one risks losing all the good sense one might still have retained. Not that I’m set on this or that by preference, I’ve become used to life here, but mustn’t forget to try the opposite a little. Whatever the case, you can see that I’m writing to you with relative calm. Ah, while I was ill, damp, melting snow was falling, I got up in the night to look at the landscape – never, never has nature appeared so touching and so sensitive to me. And this will be another lesson to me to try and work straightforwardly and without too many reservations that trouble the consciousness. A painting, a book, these mustn’t be despised, and if it’s my duty to do this, I mustn’t wish for something else. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b669 a-b V/19My dear Theo, Please don’t look at them without putting them on stretching frames and framing them in white. That’s to say, you’ll remove the nails from other canvases and mount these on the stretching frames, one by one if you like, to appreciate the effect. For the colourings absolutely need to be set off by the white frame to judge the ensemble. Thus the rain, the grey olive trees, one can scarcely see them without the frame. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b670 V/19My dear Theo, The fact is that I’ve never worked more calmly than in my latest canvases – you’re going to receive a few at the same time as this letter, I hope. For the moment I’ve been caught unawares by a great discouragement. But since this attack ended in a week, what’s the good of telling oneself that it can in fact recur? First we don’t know, nor can we foresee how and in what form. So let’s continue the work as much as possible as if nothing were amiss. I’ll soon have the opportunity to go outside when the weather isn’t too cold, and then I’d rather like to try to finish the work undertaken here. To give an idea of Provence it’s vital to do a few more canvases of cypresses and mountains. I’d very much like to go to Arles one more time, not immediately, but towards the end of February for example, first to see friends, which always cheers me up, and then to test whether I’m capable of risking the journey to Paris. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b671 V/19My dear Theo, For the moment I feel very well, and I hope that it’ll remain like that. And I even have hopes that it will be dispelled even more if I return to the north. Just mustn’t forget that a broken pitcher is a broken pitcher, and so I have no right at all to entertain pretensions. I tell myself that at home in Holland people always value painting more or less, that in an establishment they’d hardly make difficulties about letting me do it. Now, it would still be a lot, however, to have the opportunity to occupy oneself over and above painting, and it would cost less. Hasn’t the countryside and working there always been to our taste? And aren’t we a little indifferent, you as much as I, to the life of a big city? I can and I indeed want to earn some money with my painting, and we ought to ensure that my expenses don’t exceed its value, and even that the money spent comes back little by little. Well, that can be done with energy, and it’s a duty. With good behaviour I think that one can arrive at some relative freedom, even in an establishment for the insane. And it seems to me that the attacks have been too frequent, too decisive, to cease considering myself as ill. Warm regards to all. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b672 a-b V/1962 A sheet previously thought to belong to this letter lacks a beginning and displays little thematic connection with this letter. The poem ‘Who is the maid my spirit seeks’ is written on the verso. Because it is unclear which letter this sheet originally belonged to, we are including it separately. See RM1My dear Theo, Anyway, for me the good news you’ve told me and that article and a heap of things mean that I’m personally feeling completely well today. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b674 V/1962 Happy and gay Triumphant we marched  On our way to Longchamp Glad at heart. Without hesitation For we were going to celebrate To see and to compliment The Army of France. (Gais et contents Nous marchions triomphants En allant à Longchamp Le cœur à l’aise. Sans hésiter Car nous allions fêter Voir et complimenter L’armée françaiseMy dear Theo, But I consider that I must try to give him something good for that article, which is in itself a very artistic thing; and it really serves us well for the day when we, like everyone, will be obliged to try and recover what the paintings cost. Everything beyond that leaves me quite cold, but recovering the money it costs to produce, that’s the very condition of being able to continue. A few days ago I bought a suit that cost me 35 francs, I must pay for it towards the end of March. With this I’ll have sufficient for the year, for when I came here I also bought a suit for around 35 francs, and it has served me all year. But I’ll need a pair of shoes and a few pairs of drawers in March as well. All things considered, life here isn’t very expensive, I think that in the north one would spend rather more. And that’s why – even if I came to you for a while – the best policy might still be to continue the work here. I don’t know – and either is good to me – but we mustn’t hurry to move. Anyway, we’d have to begin to say to ourselves that it’s still through the same procedure that the established painters can cause troubles for adventurers, as we’d be in Antwerp, and even oblige them to decamp. And as for the dealers there, we mustn’t count on them at all. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b675 V/19My dear Theo, Don’t worry about me, even if it should last a little longer, and write the same thing to those at home and give them my warm regards. Ever yours, Vincent I’m picking up this letter again to try and write, it will come little by little, it’s just that my mind has been so affected – without pain, it’s true – but totally stupefied. I must tell you that there are – as far as I can judge – others who have this like me; who having worked during a period of their life are reduced to powerlessness even so. One doesn’t easily learn anything good between four walls, that’s understandable, but nevertheless it’s true that there are also people who can no longer be left at liberty as if they had nothing wrong with them. And so I almost or entirely despair of myself. Perhaps, perhaps I would indeed get better in the country for a time. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b677 V/1962 On the basis of the above, we think that this letter from Vincent was written shortly before Theo’s reply, i.e. on or about 17 March 189My dear Theo, You would do me a service by sending me at least half of it at once, at once, for I’ve lost too much time. around these sizes, and 7 metres of canvas, or even 10. What can I tell you of these two last months, things aren’t going well at all, I’m more sad and bored than I could tell you, and I no longer know what point I’m at. As the order for colours is a little large, let me wait for half if that suits you better. Letters have also come from home, which I haven’t yet had the courage to read, so melancholy do I feel. If you write home, give them my warm regards and tell them I think of them often. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b678 V/19My dear brother, Now, rather, you propose coming back to the north, and I accept. I’ve had too hard a life to kick the bucket as a result, or to lose the power to work. I’m almost sure that I’ll soon get better in the north, at least for quite a long time, while still apprehensive of a relapse in a few years’ time – but not immediately. That’s what I imagine after having observed the other patients here, some of whom are considerably older than I am or, among the young ones, were more or less idlers – students. Anyway, what do we know about it? Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b679 V/19My dear Theo, Once again I’m writing to you to say that I’m staying well, yet I feel a little worn out by this long crisis, and I dare believe that the planned move will refresh my ideas more. Besides, I would move anyway, preferring to be in an asylum where the patients worked to this awful idleness here, which really seems to me quite simply a crime. Anyway, you’ll tell me that this is seen more or less everywhere, and that there’s even plenty of it in Paris. Whatever the case, I hope that we’ll see each other again very soon. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b681 a-b V/19My dear brother, Now it would seem preferable to me to go and see this doctor in the country as soon as possible, and we’d leave the luggage at the station. So I would only stay at your place for let’s say 2 or 3 days, then I’d leave for this village. Where I would start off by lodging at the inn. There, you could write to him like that, we’d send him a telegram the day after my arrival in Paris, or the day after that, and he’d probably wait for me at the station. The surroundings here are starting to weigh on me more than I could express – my word, I’ve waited patiently for over a year – I need air, I feel damaged by boredom and grief. Consider, then, that the journey costs a lot, that it’s pointless and that I do have the right to change asylums if I please, it isn’t my absolute freedom that I’m demanding. As for me, my patience is at an end, at an end, my dear brother, I can’t go on, I must move, even if as a stopgap. The trunk of a pine tree violet pink, and then grass with white flowers and dandelions, a little rose bush and other tree-trunks in the background, in the uppermost part of the canvas. I’ll be out of doors there. I’m sure that the desire to work will devour me and make me insensible to everything else and in a good mood. And I’ll let myself go there, not without consideration but without dwelling on regrets for things that might have been. They say that in painting one must seek nothing and hope for nothing but a good painting and a good talk and a good dinner as the height of happiness, not counting the less brilliant interludes. Perhaps it’s true, and why refuse to take what is possible, especially if by doing so one gives the illness the slip. More soon, I hope – and come on, spare me this forced travelling companion. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b680 V/19My dear brother, I’m planning to leave as soon as possible this week, and I’m starting to pack my trunk today. I’ll send you a telegram from Tarascon. It’s likely that I’ll arrive in Paris around 5 o’clock in the morning. But anyway, the telegram will tell you precisely. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b680 V/19My dear brother I hope that the canvases of the last few days will compensate us for the expenses of travel. This morning, as I’d been to have my trunk stamped, I saw the countryside again – very fresh after the rain and covered in flowers – how many more things I would have done. Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b683 a-b V/1962 Le dernier accès qu’il a eu s’est déclaré après un voyage qu’il fit à Arles et il a duré environ deux mois. Dans l’intervalle des accès le malade est parfaitement tranquille et lucide, il se livre alors avec ardeur à la peinturI’d hope, then, that in doing a few canvases of that really seriously, there would be a chance of recouping some of the costs of my stay – for really it’s gravely beautiful, it’s the heart of the countryside, distinctive and picturesque. He directed me to an inn where they were asking 6 francs a day. And until there’s a change of circumstances I think I ought to stay there. When I’ve done a few studies I’ll see if there would be any advantage in moving. But it seems unjust to me, when one wants to and can pay and work like any other workman, to have to pay almost double all the same because one works at painting. Anyway I’m starting with the 3.50 inn. I really felt in Paris that all the noise there wasn’t what I need. Wishing you good luck and health, and hoping to see you again very soon, good handshakes Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b684 V/1962 The letter was most likely written on the day of Van Gogh’s arrival in Auvers. In this letter he tells about his first visit to Gachet and reflects on his stay in PariIt’s as I supposed, I see violets more where they are. There’s a lot to draw here. I can’t do anything about that. Not working or working less would cost double, that’s all I can foresee IF we sought another way of arriving than the natural way, working – which we shan’t do. I had that in Paris, and here too. But as work is proceeding a little, serenity will come. Whatever the case, I don’t regret coming back here, and things will go better here. Will be very pleased if in a little while from now you could come here one Sunday with your family. You’ll clearly see that to understand the countryside and the culture it only does one good to see other lands. But I find the modern villas and the middle-class country houses almost as pretty as the old thatched cottages that are falling into ruin. Most cordial handshakes. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b685 V/19Ever yours, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b686 V/19My dear Theo, So I’m looking forward to doing the portraits of all of you in the open air, yours, Jo’s and the little one’s. I still haven’t found anything interesting in the way of a possible studio, and yet I’ll have to take a room to put in the canvases which are surplus at your apartment and which are at Tanguy’s. For they still need a great deal of retouching. But anyway, I live from day to day – the weather is so fine. And my health is good, I go to bed at 9 o’clock but I get up at 5 o’clock most of the time. I have hopes that it won’t be disagreeable to be together again after a long absence. And I also hope that I’ll continue to feel much surer of my brush than before I went to Arles. And Mr Gachet says that he would consider it highly improbable that it should recur, and that it’s going completely well. But he, too, complains bitterly of the state of things everywhere in the villages where the least foreigner has come, that life there becomes so horribly expensive. He says that he’s astonished that the people where I am lodge and feed me for that, and that I’m still fortunate, compared to others who have come and whom he’s known. That if you come, and Jo and the little one, you can’t do better than stay at this same inn. Now nothing, absolutely nothing keeps us here but Gachet – but the latter will remain a friend, I’d assume. I feel that at his place I can do not too bad a painting every time I go there, and he’ll certainly continue to invite me to dinner each Sunday or Monday. But the modern idea of eating one, at most two courses is, however, certainly progress, and a healthy return to true antiquity. But his house, you will see, is full, full like an antique dealer’s, of things that aren’t always interesting, it’s terrible, even. But in all of this there’s this good aspect, that there would always be what I need there for arranging flowers or still lifes. I’ve done studies for him, to show him that should he not be paid in money we’ll nevertheless still compensate him for what he does for us. Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b687 V/19What can you do, in the south it isn’t entirely as it is in the north. The people there do what they want and don’t give themselves the trouble of thinking or paying attention to others if one isn’t there. On my side, too, it causes me distress to stir all this up by writing to people. Yours truly, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b689 V/19My dear Theo, Ever yours, Vincent. Reproduction UnknoMy dear Theo, Yours truly, Vincent. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b690 V/19My dear Theo, Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b692V/1962 We assume the letter is complete, even though the signature is lacking. Van Gogh enclosed an unknown letter from PeyroMy dear Theo, The wall in the background green with orange spots, the carpet red with green spots, the piano dark violet. It’s 1 metre high and 50 wide. It’s a figure I enjoyed painting – but it’s difficult. Ever yours, Vincent Unknown On 29 June Theo informed his mother and Willemien that he had received an ‘excellent letter’ from Vincent that day (FR b932). Because this must have been the present letter, we have dated it to Saturday, 28 June 1890. Van Gogh enclosed an order for paint, which has not been preserveHere are three croquis – one of a figure of a peasant woman, big yellow hat with a knot of sky-blue ribbons, very red face. Coarse blue blouse with orange spots, background of ears of wheat. What will be, will be, you haven’t spared yourself trouble for them, you’ve served them with an exemplary fidelity all the time. I, too, am trying to do as well as I can, but I don’t hide from you that I scarcely dare count on always having the necessary health. And if my illness recurred you would excuse me, I still love art and life very much, but as to ever having a wife of my own I don’t believe in it very strongly. I fear, rather, that towards let’s say the age of forty – but let’s not say anything – I declare that I know nothing, absolutely nothing, of what turn it may yet take. Ever yours, Vincent He’ll probably show you some of his studies, which are still rather lifeless, but however he does observe nature. He has been here in Auvers for months, and we went out together sometimes, he was brought up in Japan, you would never think so from his painting – but that may come. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b694 V/19Handshakes in thought. Ever yours, Vincent Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. no. b697 V/19My dear brother, As regards the state of peace in your household, I’m just as convinced of the possibility of preserving it as of the storms that threaten it. What seems to me on my return – is that the painters themselves are increasingly at bay. Very well. But has the moment to make them understand the utility of a union not rather passed already? On the other hand a union, if it were formed, would go under if the rest went under. Then you’d perhaps tell me that dealers would unite for the Impressionists; that would be very fleeting. Anyway it seems to me that personal initiative remains ineffective, and having done the experiment, would one begin it again? Which would be simplest. Or you’d put them into the consignment of colours for me, adding the invoice or telling me how much they cost, and then he’d send you the money. Here one can’t find anything good in the way of colours. I’ve simplified my own order to a very bare minimum. Yours truly, Vincent. Foreground of green and pink grass, on the left a green and lilac bush and a stem of plants with whitish foliage. In the middle a bed of roses. To the right a hurdle, a wall, and above the wall a hazel tree with violet foliage. Original manuscript Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. b699 a-c V/1962 Sheets 2 and 3 were originally joine\n"
